Motivation
I’m not a machine learning expert. I’m a software engineer by training and I’ve had little interaction with AI. I had always wanted to delve deeper into machine learning, but never really found my “in”. That’s why when Google open sourced TensorFlow in November 2015, I got super excited and knew it was time to jump in and start the learning journey. Not to sound dramatic, but to me, it actually felt kind of like Prometheus handing down fire to mankind from the Mount Olympus of machine learning. In the back of my head was the idea that the entire field of Big Data and technologies like Hadoop were vastly accelerated when Google researchers released their Map Reduce paper. This time it’s not a paper – it’s the actual software they use internally after years and years of evolution.

So I started learning what I can about the basics of the topic, and saw the need for gentler resources for people with no experience in the field. This is my attempt at that.},

	doi = {10.1109/CEC.2016.7743773},
	abstract = {Breast cancer is known as the second largest cause of cancer deaths among women, but thankfully it can be cured if diagnosed early. There have been many investigations on methods to improve the accuracy of the diagnostic, and Machine Learning (ML) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) tools are among the most successfully employed modern methods. On the other hand, Logistic Regression (LR), a traditional and popular statistical method for classification, is not commonly used by computer scientists as those modern methods usually outperform it. Here we show that LR can achieve results that are similar to those of ML and EC methods and can even outperform them when useful knowledge is discovered in the dataset. In this paper, we employ the recently proposed Kaizen Programming (KP) approach with LR to construct high-quality nonlinear combinations of the original features resulting in new sets of features. Experimental analysis indicates that the new sets provide significantly better predictive accuracy than the original ones. When compared to related work from the literature, it is shown that the proposed approach is competitive and a promising method for automatic feature construction.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose a computer-assisted method for distinguishing uterine sarcoma from leiomyomas based on perfusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two women confirmed to have a total of 60 masses (10 uterine sarcomas and 50 benign leiomyomas) were included. The reference diagnosis was based on postoperative histopathological examination. All women underwent the standard MRI protocol with 3-Tesla MR imager (Magnetom Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) for assessment of myometrial masses, followed by PWI. For each mass, two regions of interest (ROI) were outlined manually by an experienced radiologist; one (ROIL) represented the entire tumor while the other (ROIs) was placed on the area of the lesion with the most marked contrast enhancement. Two additional ROIs with diameters similar to ROIs (3.0 to 3.1 mm) were placed on psoas muscle (ROIP) and myometrium (ROIM) in order to provide baselines for comparisons. The obtained ROIs of PWI images were then analyzed using the DCE Tool plug-in (version 2.0SP1) within ClearCanvas (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) framework. The DCE Tool provides seven parameters (Ktrans, kep, Vb, IAUC, initial slope, peak, the mean squared error) for modelling contrast uptake within an ROI using the modified Tofts model. Parameters extracted from the ROIs were fed into a decision tree ensemble, which classified the corresponding lesions either as malignant or benign. The leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was utilized to evaluate the performance of the classifier.
RESULTS: None of the parameters extracted from ROIL or ROIs differed significantly between uterine sarcoma and benign leiomyomas (all p {\textgreater} 0.05). The overall accuracy of 66.7\% was obtained by feeding seven parameters extracted from ROIL to the classifier. When 21 features extracted from ROIL, ROIM, and ROIP were fed into the classifier an accuracy of 91.7\%, sensitivity of 100\%, and specificity of 90\% were achieved in the optimal operating point of classifier.
CONCLUSION: Although none of the PWI parameters differed significantly between benign and malignant lesions, when the information provided by the extracted features was aggregated using a machine learning method, a promising discriminative power was obtained. This suggests that the proposed model for combining the PWI parameters is potentially useful for differentiating uterine sarcoma from leiomyomas.},

	abstract = {Introducing novel biomarkers for accurately detecting and differentiating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) using clinical samples is essential. In the current study, we searched for a novel data-driven gene signature of synovial tissues to differentiate RA from OA patients. Fifty-three RA, 41 OA, and 25 normal microarray-based transcriptome samples were utilized. The area under the curve random forests (RF) variable importance measurement was applied to seek the most influential differential genes between RA and OA. Five algorithms including RF, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machines (SVM), naïve-Bayes, and a tree-based method were employed for the classification. We found a 16-gene signature that could effectively differentiate RA from OA, including TMOD1, POP7, SGCA, KLRD1, ALOX5, RAB22A, ANK3, PTPN3, GZMK, CLU, GZMB, FBXL7, TNFRSF4, IL32, MXRA7, and CD8A. The externally validated accuracy of the RF model was 0.96 (sensitivity = 1.00, specificity = 0.90). Likewise, the accuracy of kNN, SVM, naïve-Bayes, and decision tree was 0.96, 0.96, 0.96, and 0.91, respectively. Functional meta-analysis exhibited the differential pathological processes of RA and OA; suggested promising targets for further mechanistic and therapeutic studies. In conclusion, the proposed genetic signature combined with sophisticated classification methods may improve the diagnosis and management of RA patients.},

effectiveness of data augmentation through simple techniques, such as cropping,
rotating, and flipping input images. We artificially constrain our access to
data to a small subset of the ImageNet dataset, and compare each data
augmentation technique in turn. One of the more successful data augmentations
strategies is the traditional transformations mentioned above. We also
experiment with GANs to generate images of different styles. Finally, we
propose a method to allow a neural net to learn augmentations that best improve
the classifier, which we call neural augmentation. We discuss the successes and
shortcomings of this method on various datasets.},

	abstract = {Tumour budding has been described as an independent prognostic feature in several tumour types. We report for the first time the relationship between tumour budding and survival evaluated in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. A machine learning-based methodology was applied to accurately quantify tumour buds across immunofluorescence labelled whole slide images from 100 muscle invasive bladder cancer patients. Furthermore, tumour budding was found to be correlated to TNM (p = 0.00089) and pT (p = 0.0078) staging. A novel classification and regression tree model was constructed to stratify all stage II, III, and IV patients into three new staging criteria based on disease specific survival. For the stratification of non-metastatic patients into high or low risk of disease specific death, our decision tree model reported that tumour budding was the most significant feature (HR = 2.59, p = 0.0091), and no clinical feature was utilised to categorise these patients. Our findings demonstrate that tumour budding, quantified using automated image analysis provides prognostic value for muscle invasive bladder cancer patients and a better model fit than TNM staging.},

	abstract = {Do men and women have different brains? Previous neuroimage studies sought to answer this question based on morphological difference between specific brain regions, reporting unfortunately conflicting results. In the present study, we aim to use a deep learning technique to address this challenge based on a large open-access, diffusion MRI database recorded from 1,065 young healthy subjects, including 490 men and 575 women healthy subjects. Different from commonly used 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we proposed a 3D CNN method with a newly designed structure including three hidden layers in cascade with a linear layer and a terminal Softmax layer. The proposed 3D CNN was applied to the maps of factional anisotropy (FA) in the whole-brain as well as specific brain regions. The entropy measure was applied to the lowest-level image features extracted from the first hidden layer to examine the difference of brain structure complexity between men and women. The obtained results compared with the results from using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). The proposed 3D CNN yielded a better classification result (93.3\%) than the SVM (78.2\%) on the whole-brain FA images, indicating gender-related differences likely exist in the whole-brain range. Moreover, high classification accuracies are also shown in several specific brain regions including the left precuneus, the left postcentral gyrus, the left cingulate gyrus, the right orbital gyrus of frontal lobe, and the left occipital thalamus in the gray matter, and middle cerebellum peduncle, genu of corpus callosum, the right anterior corona radiata, the right superior corona radiata and the left anterior limb of internal capsule in the while matter. This study provides a new insight into the structure difference between men and women, which highlights the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in brain research.},
