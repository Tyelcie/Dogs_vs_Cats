	abstract = {Finding genes that are differentially expressed between conditions is an integral part of understanding the molecular basis of phenotypic variation. In the past decades, DNA microarrays have been used extensively to quantify the abundance of mRNA corresponding to different genes, and more recently high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful competitor. As the cost of sequencing decreases, it is conceivable that the use of RNA-seq for differential expression analysis will increase rapidly. To exploit the possibilities and address the challenges posed by this relatively new type of data, a number of software packages have been developed especially for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data.},

Greek territory. One hundred and sixty-four individuals with SCI living in the community for at least 1 year after the completion of the primary inpatient rehabilitation program were included in the study. Our group of participants were enrolled from multiple rehabilitation centers throughout Greece and were evaluated for probable depression according to the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Univariable and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess the possible association of risk factors with the occurrence of depression. We had also examined the correlation between PHQ-9 and scales measuring social reintegration (Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique (CHART)), quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF (WHOQOL-BREF)), and independence (Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM)). It was found that 18.2\% of the sample had probable depression. The mean (SD) PHQ-9 score was 5.7  (4.9). The multiple linear regression analysis showed that high pain scores (P = 0.001) and suffering from both nociceptive and neuropathic pain (P = 0.005) were associated with depressive mood, while pressure ulcers had a significant effect (P = 0.049) only in the univariable analysis. Participant’s PHQ-9 scores had also a negative correlation with almost all CHART, WHOQOL-BREF, and SCIM subscales’ scores. This study documents relatively low rates of probable depression among individuals with SCI in Greece. Severe pain and pressure ulcers were the main identified predictors of depressive mood.},

	abstract = {Several studies link increasing body mass index (BMI) to cognitive decline both as a consequence of obesity per se and as a sequela of obesity-induced type 2 diabetes. Obese individuals are prone to a chronic low-grade inflammation as the metabolically active visceral fat produces proinflammatory cytokines. Animal studies indicate that these cytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier. Such crossover could potentially affect the immune system in the brain by inducing gene expression of proinflammatory genes. The relationship between obesity and neuroinflammation in the human brain is currently unknown. Therefore we aim to examine the relationship between BMI and gene expression of central inflammatory markers in the human frontal cortex. Microarray data of 141 neurologically and psychiatrically healthy individuals were obtained through the BrainCloud database. A simple linear regression analysis was performed with BMI as variable on data on IL10, IL1β, IL6, PTGS2 (COX2) and NOS2 (iNOS). Increasing BMI is associated with a decrease in the mRNA expression of IL10 (P=0.014) and an increase in the expression of NOS2 (iNOS; P=0.040). Expressions of IL10 and NOS2 (iNOS) were negatively correlated (P{\textless}0.001). The expression of IL10 was mostly affected by individuals with BMI ⩾40. Multiple linear regression analyses with BMI, age, sex and race as variables were performed in order to identify potential confounders. In conclusion, increasing BMI could affect the IL10-mediated anti-inflammatory defense in the brain and induce iNOS-mediated inflammatory activity.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is the most common gastroenterology-related reason for hospital admission, and a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. This study examines the National Emergency Database Sample, a large national database, to analyze trends in emergency department (ED) utilization and costs, risk factors for hospital admission, and associated hospital costs and length of stay (LOS) in patients presenting with AP.
METHODS: The National Emergency Database Sample (2006 to 2012) was evaluated for trends in ED visits, ED charges, hospitalization rates, hospital charges, and hospital LOS in patients with primary diagnosis of AP (further subcategorized by age and etiology). A survey logistic-regression model was used to determine factors predictive of hospitalization.
RESULTS: A total of 2,193,830 ED visits were analyzed. There was a nonsignificant 5.5\% (P=0.07) increase in incidence of ED visits for AP per 10,000 US adults from 2006 to 2012, largely driven by significant increases in ED visits for AP in the 18 to {\textless}45 age group (+9.2\%; P=0.025), AP associated with alcohol (+15.9\%; P=0.001), and AP associated with chronic pancreatitis (+59.5\%; P=0.002). Visits for patients aged ≥65 decreased over the time period. Rates of admission and LOS decreased during the time period, while ED and inpatient costs increased (62.1\%; P{\textless}0.001 and 7.9\%; P=0.0011, respectively). Multiple factors were associated with increased risk of hospital admission from the ED, with the strongest predictors being morbid alcohol use [odds ratio (OR), 4.53; P{\textless}0.0001], advanced age (age{\textgreater}84 OR, 3.52; P{\textless}0.0001), and smoking (OR, 1.75; P{\textless}0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a relative stabilization in the overall incidence of ED visits for AP, continued increases in ED visits and associated costs appear to be driven by younger patients with alcohol-associated and acute on chronic pancreatitis. While rates of hospitalization and LOS are decreasing, associated inflation-adjusted costs are rising. In addition, identified risk factors for hospitalization, such as obesity, alcohol use, and increased age, should be explored in further study for potential use in predictive models and clinical improvement projects.},

In this study, we constructed and validated a prognostic gene model to evaluate the risks of GC patients. To identify the differentially expressed genes between GC patients and controls, we extracted Gene expression profiles of GC patients (N=432) from Gene Expression Omnibus database and then stable signature genes by using Robust likelihood-based modeling with 1000 iterations. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of all samples was performed basing on the characteristics of gene expressions. Meanwhile, the differences between the clusters were analyzed by Kaplan Meier survival analysis. A 9-genes model was obtained (frequency = 999; p=1.333628e-18), including two negative impact factors (NR1I2 and LGALSL) and 7 positive ones (C1ORF198, CST2, LAMP5, FOXS1, CES1P1, MMP7 and COL8A1). This model was verified in single factor survival analysis (p=0.004447558) and significant analysis with recurrence time (p=0.001474831) by using independent datasets from TCGA. The constructed 9-genes model was stable and effective, which might serve as prognostic signature to predict the survival of GC patients and monitor the long-term treatment of GC.},

Because of HCC’s high heterogeneity, it has been suggested that multiple biomarkers would be needed to develop a sensitive HCC screening test. This study applied random forest (RF), a machine learning technique, and proposed two novel models, fixed sequential (FS) and two-step (TS), for comparison with two commonly used statistical techniques, logistic regression (LR) and classification and regression trees (CART), in combining multiple urine DNA biomarkers for HCC screening using biomarker values obtained from 137 HCC and 431 non-HCC (224 hepatitis and 207 cirrhosis) subjects. The sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating curve, and variability were estimated through repeated 10-fold cross-validation to compare the models’ performances in accuracy and robustness. We show that RF and TS have higher accuracy and stability; specifically, they reach 90\% specificity and 86\%/87\% sensitivity respectively along with 15\% higher sensitivity and 10\% higher specificity than LR in cross-validation. The potential of RF and TS to develop a panel of multiple biomarkers and the possibility for self-training, cloud-based models for HCC screening are discussed.},

	abstract = {Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) require differential management despite presenting with symptomatic overlap. Currently, there is a need of inexpensive DLB biomarkers which can be fulfilled by electroencephalography (EEG). In this regard, an established electrophysiological difference in DLB is a decrease of dominant frequency (DF)—the frequency with the highest signal power between 4 and 15 Hz. Here, we investigated network connectivity in EEG signals acquired from DLB patients, and whether these networks were able to differentiate DLB from healthy controls (HCs) and associated dementias. We analysed EEG recordings from old adults: HCs, AD, DLB and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) patients. Brain networks were assessed with the minimum spanning tree (MST) within six EEG bands: delta, theta, high-theta, alpha, beta and DF. Patients showed lower alpha band connectivity and lower DF than HCs. DLB and PDD showed a randomised MST compared with HCs and AD in high-theta and alpha but not in DF. The MST randomisation in DLB and PDD reflects decreased brain efficiency as well as impaired neural synchronisation. However, the lack of network topology differences at the DF between all dementia groups and HCs may indicate a compensatory response of the brain to the neuropathology.},

	abstract = {Logistic regression is often used instead of Cox regression to analyse genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and disease outcomes with cohort and case-cohort designs, as it is less computationally expensive. Although Cox and logistic regression models have been compared previously in cohort studies, this work does not completely cover the GWAS setting nor extend to the case-cohort study design. Here, we evaluated Cox and logistic regression applied to cohort and case-cohort genetic association studies using simulated data and genetic data from the EPIC-CVD study. In the cohort setting, there was a modest improvement in power to detect SNP–disease associations using Cox regression compared with logistic regression, which increased as the disease incidence increased. In contrast, logistic regression had more power than (Prentice weighted) Cox regression in the case-cohort setting. Logistic regression yielded inflated effect estimates (assuming the hazard ratio is the underlying measure of association) for both study designs, especially for SNPs with greater effect on disease. Given logistic regression is substantially more computationally efficient than Cox regression in both settings, we propose a two-step approach to GWAS in cohort and case-cohort studies. First to analyse all SNPs with logistic regression to identify associated variants below a pre-defined P-value threshold, and second to fit Cox regression (appropriately weighted in case-cohort studies) to those identified SNPs to ensure accurate estimation of association with disease.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.11.012},
	abstract = {DNA flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) plays critical roles in maintaining genome stability and integrity by participating in both DNA replication and repair. Suppression of FEN1 in cells leads to the retardation of DNA replication and accumulation of unrepaired DNA intermediates, resulting in DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and apoptosis. Therefore, targeting FEN1 could serve as a potent strategy for cancer therapy. In this study, we demonstrated that FEN1 is overexpressed in breast cancers and is essential for rapid proliferation of cancer cells. We showed that manipulating FEN1 levels in cells alters the response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, we identified a small molecular compound, SC13 that specifically inhibits FEN1 activity, thereby interfering with DNA replication and repair in vitro and in cells. SC13 suppresses cancer cell proliferation and induces chromosome instability and cytotoxicity in cells. Importantly, SC13 sensitizes cancer cells to DNA damage-inducing therapeutic modalities and impedes cancer progression in a mouse model. These findings could establish a paradigm for the treatment of breast cancer and other cancers as well.},

We examined Sugar Research Foundation (SRF) internal documents, historical reports, and statements relevant to early debates about the dietary causes of CHD and assembled findings chronologically into a narrative case study. The SRF sponsored its first CHD research project in 1965, a literature review published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which singled out fat and cholesterol as the dietary causes of CHD and downplayed evidence that sucrose consumption was also a risk factor. The SRF set the review's objective, contributed articles for inclusion, and received drafts. The SRF's funding and role was not disclosed. Together with other recent analyses of sugar industry documents, our findings suggest the industry sponsored a research program in the 1960s and 1970s that successfully cast doubt about the hazards of sucrose while promoting fat as the dietary culprit in CHD. Policymaking committees should consider giving less weight to food industry-funded studies and include mechanistic and animal studies as well as studies appraising the effect of added sugars on multiple CHD biomarkers and disease development.},

	abstract = {Over the past quarter-century, historical research has revealed how major industries from tobacco to lead to petroleum have meddled in science to conceal the hazards of their products. Drawing on secret industry documents, these studies have shown how special interests have used financial incentives to influence scientists, fabricate doubt, and delay regulation (1). Recently, similar allegations have been made against the sugar industry, with claims that prominent industry-backed researchers in the 1960s downplayed or suppressed evidence linking sugar and heart disease. Building on a newly popular narrative holding that the low-fat campaign of the 1980s was not based on solid science, these allegations have suggested that if not for the machinations of the sugar industry and its cadre of sponsored researchers, the history of U.S. dietary policy might have unfolded very differently. In this article, we argue that the historical evidence does not support these claims. Although we do not defend the sugar industry and cannot address every aspect of this history, we believe recent high-profile claims come from researchers who have overextended the analogy of the tobacco industry playbook and failed to assess historical actors by the norms and standards of their time. Our analysis illustrates how conspiratorial narratives in science can distort the past in the service of contemporary causes and obscure genuine uncertainty that surrounds aspects of research, impairing efforts to formulate good evidence-informed policies. In the absence of very strong evidence, there is a serious danger in interpreting the inevitable twists and turns of research and policy as the product of malevolent playbooks and historical derailments. Like scientists, historians must focus on the evidence and follow the data where they lead.

Both development and the maintenance of homeostasis result in the production of superfluous cells that must eventually be disposed of. Furthermore, programmed cell death can also represent a defense mechanism; for example, by depriving pathogens of a replication niche. The responsibility of handling these dead cells falls on phagocytes of the immune system, which surveil their surroundings for dying or dead cells and efficiently clear them in a quiescent manner. This process, termed efferocytosis, depends on cooperation between the phagocyte and the dying cell. In this review we explore different types of programmed cell death and their impact on innate immune responses.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {While inflammation has been associated with the development and progression of colorectal cancer, the exact role of the inflammatory Th17 pathway remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the relative importance of IL-17A and the master regulator of the Th17 pathway, the transcription factor RORγt, in the sporadic intestinal neoplasia of APC(MIN/+) mice and in human colorectal cancer. We show that levels of IL-17A are increased in human colon cancer as compared to adjacent uninvolved colon. Similarly, naïve helper T cells from colorectal cancer patients are more inducible into the Th17 pathway. Furthermore, IL-17A, IL-21, IL-22, and IL-23 are all demonstrated to be directly mitogenic to human colorectal cancer cell lines. Nevertheless, deficiency of IL-17A but not RORγt is associated with decreased spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis in the APC(MIN/+) mouse model, despite the fact that helper T cells from RORγt-deficient APC(MIN/+) mice do not secrete IL-17A when subjected to Th17-polarizing conditions and that Il17a expression is decreased in the intestine of RORγt-deficient APC(MIN/+) mice. Differential expression of Th17-associated cytokines between IL-17A-deficient and RORγt-deficient APC(MIN/+) mice may explain the difference in adenoma development.},

	abstract = {A female advantage in melanoma incidence and outcome has been consistently observed but remains unexplained. We hypothesized that tumors are genetically distinct between men and women and analyzed the mutation spectra in 266 metastatic melanomas (102 women and 164 men) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found a statistically significantly greater burden of missense mutations among men (male median 298 vs female median = 211.5; male-to-female ratio [M:F] = 1.85, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.44 to 2.39). We validated these initial findings using available data from a separate melanoma exome cohort (n = 95) and found a similar increase in missense mutations among men (male median 393 vs female median 259; M:F = 1.59, 95\% CI = 1.12 to 2.27). In addition, survival improves with increasing log-transformed missense mutation count (univariate hazard ratio = 0.82, 95\% CI = 0.69 to 0.98) for TCGA samples. Our analyses are the first to demonstrate a gender difference in mutation burden in cutaneous melanoma.},

MUC1 expression was studied in patient-derived bone metastasis and CRPCs produced by prostate-specific PTEN−/− mice and LNCaP xenografts. Elevations in MUC1 expression occur in CRPC. Among nine patients with hormone-naïve bone metastasis, eight express MUC1 in 61\% to 100\% of PC cells. Utilizing cBioPortal PC genomic data, we organized a training (n = 300), testing (n = 185), and validation (n = 194) cohort. Using the Cox model, a nine-gene signature was derived, including eight genes from a MUC1-related network (APC, CTNNB1/β-catenin, GALNT10, GRB2, LYN, SIGLEC1, SOS1, and ZAP70) and FAM84B. Genomic alterations in these genes reduce disease-free survival (DFS) in the training (P = .00161), testing (P = .00699), entire (training + testing, P = 5.557e-5), and a validation cohort (P = 3.326e-5). The signature independently predicts PC recurrence [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.731; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.104-2.712; P = .0167] after adjusting for known clinical factors and stratifies patients with high risk of PC recurrence using the median (HR 2.072; 95\% CI: 1.245-3.450, P = .0051) and quartile 3 (HR 3.707, 95\% CI: 1.949-7.052, P = 6.51e-5) scores. Several novel β-catenin mutants are identified in PCs leading to a rapid onset of death and recurrence. Genomic alterations in APC and CTNNB1/β-catenin reduce DFS in two independent PC cohorts (n = 485, P = .0369; n = 84, P = .0437). The nine-gene signature also associates with reductions in overall survival (P = .0458) and DFS (P = .0163) in melanoma patients (n = 367). MUC1 upregulation is associated with CRPC and bone metastasis. A nine-gene signature derived from a MUC1 network predicts PC recurrence.},

To investigate the prospective role of lncRNAs in the tumorigenesis and progression of LUSC, the aberrantly expressed lncRNAs were calculated based on The Cancer Genome Atlas RNA-seq data. Of 7589 lncRNAs with 504 LUSC cases, 884 lncRNAs were identified as being aberrantly expressed ({\textbar}log2 fold change{\textbar} {\textgreater}2 and adjusted P{\textless}0.05) by DESeq R. The top 10 lncRNAs with the highest diagnostic value were SFTA1P,LINC00968, LINC00961, LINC01572,RP1-78O14.1, FENDRR, LINC01314,LINC01272, GATA6-AS1, and MIR3945HG. In addition to the significant roles in the carcinogenesis of LUSC, several lncRNAs also played vital parts in the survival and progression of LUSC. SFTA1P, LINC01272, GATA6-AS1 and MIR3945HG were closely related to the survival time of LUSC. Furthermore, LINC01572 and LINC01314 could distinguish the LUSC at early stage from that at advanced stage. The prospective molecular assessment of key lncRNAs showed that a certain series of genes could be involved in the regulation network. Furthermore, the OncoPrint from cBioPortal indicated that 14\% (69/501) LUSC cases with genetic alterations could be obtained, including amplification, deep deletion and mRNA upregulation. More interestingly, the cases with genetic alterations had a poorer survival as compared to those without alterations. Overall, the study propounds a potentiality for interpreting the pathogenesis and development of LUSC with lncRNAs, and provides a novel platform for searching for more capable diagnostic biomarkers for LUSC.},

	abstract = {Background
The telomerase/telomere interacting protein PinX1 has been suggested as a tumor suppressor. However, the clinical and biological significance of PinX1 in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unclear.

Methods
PinX1 gene/expression pattern and its association with NSCLC patient survival were analyzed in cBioportal Web resource and two cohorts of NSCLC samples. A series of in vivo and in vitro assays were performed to elucidate the function of PinX1 on NSCLC cells proliferation and underlying mechanisms.

Results
More frequency of gene PinX1 homozygous deletion and heterozygote deficiency was first retrieved from cBioportal Web resource. Low expression of PinX1 correlated with smoking condition, histological type, T stage, N stage, M stage and TNM stage, and was an independent predictor for overall survival in a learning cohort (n = 93) and a validation cohort (n = 51) of NSCLC patients. Furthermore, knockdown of PinX1 dramatically accelerated NSCLC cell proliferation and G1/S transition, whereas ectopic overexpression of PinX1 substantially inhibited cell viability and cell cycle transition in vitro and in vivo. p15/cyclin D1 pathway and BMP5 might contribute to PinX1-associated cell proliferation and cell cycle transition.

Conclusion
The cost-effective expression of PinX1 could constitute a novel molecular predictor/marker for NSCLC management.

	abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths that will occur in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival. Incidence data were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2017, 1,688,780 new cancer cases and 600,920 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. For all sites combined, the cancer incidence rate is 20\% higher in men than in women, while the cancer death rate is 40\% higher. However, sex disparities vary by cancer type. For example, thyroid cancer incidence rates are 3-fold higher in women than in men (21 vs 7 per 100,000 population), despite equivalent death rates (0.5 per 100,000 population), largely reflecting sex differences in the "epidemic of diagnosis." Over the past decade of available data, the overall cancer incidence rate (2004-2013) was stable in women and declined by approximately 2\% annually in men, while the cancer death rate (2005-2014) declined by about 1.5\% annually in both men and women. From 1991 to 2014, the overall cancer death rate dropped 25\%, translating to approximately 2,143,200 fewer cancer deaths than would have been expected if death rates had remained at their peak. Although the cancer death rate was 15\% higher in blacks than in whites in 2014, increasing access to care as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may expedite the narrowing racial gap; from 2010 to 2015, the proportion of blacks who were uninsured halved, from 21\% to 11\%, as it did for Hispanics (31\% to 16\%). Gains in coverage for traditionally underserved Americans will facilitate the broader application of existing cancer control knowledge across every segment of the population.

In the current study, we reported that CISD2 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly upregulated in gastric cancer cells compared to normal gastric epithelial cells (P {\textless} 0.001). Immunohistochemical analysis of 261 paraffin-embedded archived gastric cancer tissues showed that high CISD2 expression was significantly associated with clinical stage, TNM classifications, venous invasion and lymphatic invasion. Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that high CISD2 expression was an independent prognostic factor for poorer overall survival in the entire cohort. Overexpressing CISD2 promoted, while silencing CISD2 inhibited, the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that silencing endogenous CISD2 also significantly inhibited the proliferation and tumorigenicity of MGC-803 and SGC-7901 cells not only in vitro but also in vivo in NOD/SCID mice (P {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, we found that CISD2 affected cell proliferation and tumorigenicity of gastric cancer cells through mediating the G1-to-S phase transition. Moreover, we demonstrated that the pro-proliferative effect of CISD2 on gastric cancer cells was associated with downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, and activation of AKT signaling. The findings of this study indicate that CISD2 may promote proliferation and tumorigenicity, potentially representing a novel prognostic marker for overall survival in gastric cancer.},

Here, we identify a novel epigenetic regulation of miR-766-3p and investigate its biological function as well as clinical significance in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Bisulfate analysis elucidates that the promoter of miR-766-3p is highly methylated in RCC tissues compared to non-tumorous tissues. Notably, the downregulation of miR-766-3p is obviously associated with clinical stage and worse prognosis in RCC patients. Upregulated miR-766-3p attenuates cell-cycle progression via targeting SF2 expression and additional SF2/P-AKT/P-ERK signaling pathway. Moreover, high level of SF2, as a novel oncoprotein in RCC, was significantly associated with poor survival in a large cohort of RCC specimens. Taken together, our study presents a road map for the prediction and validation of miR-766-3p/SF2 axis and thus imparts a therapeutic way for further RCC progression.},

Our previous study has shown that cooperativity of MKL-1 and STAT3 promoted breast cancer cell migration. Herein, we demonstrate a requirement for MKL-1 and STAT3 in miRNA-mediated cellular EMT to affect breast cancer cell migration. Here we show that cooperativity of MKL-1 and STAT3 promoted the EMT of MCF-7 cells. Importantly, MKL-1 and STAT3 promoted the expression of Vimentin via its promoter CArG box. Interestingly, miR-93-5p inhibits the EMT of breast cancer cells through suppressing the expression of MKL-1 and STAT3 via targeted their 3'UTR.

The APOE pathway mediated a switch from a homeostatic to a neurodegenerative microglia phenotype after phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons. TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) induced APOE signaling, and targeting the TREM2-APOE pathway restored the homeostatic signature of microglia in ALS and AD mouse models and prevented neuronal loss in an acute model of neurodegeneration. APOE-mediated neurodegenerative microglia had lost their tolerogenic function. Our work identifies the TREM2-APOE pathway as a major regulator of microglial functional phenotype in neurodegenerative diseases and serves as a novel target that could aid in the restoration of homeostatic microglia.},

We find that oncogenic BRAF paradoxically suppresses stem cell renewal and instead promotes differentiation. Correspondingly, tumor formation is inefficient in BRAF-driven mouse models of colon cancer. By reducing levels of differentiation via genetic manipulation of either of two distinct differentiation-promoting factors (\textit{Smad4} or \textit{Cdx2}), stem cell activity is restored in BRAF$^{\textrm{V600E}}$ intestines, and the oncogenic capacity of BRAF$^{\textrm{V600E}}$ is amplified. In human patients, we observe that reduced levels of differentiation in normal tissue is associated with increased susceptibility to serrated colon tumors. Together, these findings help resolve the conditions necessary for BRAF-driven colon cancer initiation. Additionally, our results predict that genetic and/or environmental factors that reduce tissue differentiation will increase susceptibility to serrated colon cancer. These findings offer an opportunity to identify susceptible individuals by assessing their tissue-differentiation status.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Cancer cells can exploit the programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint pathway to avoid immune surveillance by modulating T-lymphocyte activity. In part, this may occur through overexpression of PD-1 and PD-1 pathway ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) in the tumor microenvironment. PD-1 blockade has produced significant antitumor activity in solid tumors, and similar evidence has emerged in hematologic malignancies.
METHODS: In this phase I, open-label, dose-escalation, cohort-expansion study, patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma received the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab at doses of 1 or 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nivolumab and to assess PD-L1/PD-L2 locus integrity and protein expression.
RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were treated (follicular lymphoma, n = 10; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, n = 11; other B-cell lymphomas, n = 10; mycosis fungoides, n = 13; peripheral T-cell lymphoma, n = 5; other T-cell lymphomas, n = 5; multiple myeloma, n = 27). Patients had received a median of three (range, one to 12) prior systemic treatments. Drug-related adverse events occurred in 51 (63\%) patients, and most were grade 1 or 2. Objective response rates were 40\%, 36\%, 15\%, and 40\% among patients with follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mycosis fungoides, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, respectively. Median time of follow-up observation was 66.6 weeks (range, 1.6 to 132.0+ weeks). Durations of response in individual patients ranged from 6.0 to 81.6+ weeks.
CONCLUSION: Nivolumab was well tolerated and exhibited antitumor activity in extensively pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory B- and T-cell lymphomas. Additional studies of nivolumab in these diseases are ongoing.},

	abstract = {The direction of an association at the population-level may be reversed within the subgroups comprising that population—a striking observation called Simpson's paradox. When facing this pattern, psychologists often view it as anomalous. Here, we argue that Simpson's paradox is more common than conventionally thought, and typically results in incorrect interpretations—potentially with harmful consequences. We support this claim by reviewing results from cognitive neuroscience, behavior genetics, clinical psychology, personality psychology, educational psychology, intelligence research, and simulation studies. We show that Simpson's paradox is most likely to occur when inferences are drawn across different levels of explanation (e.g., from populations to subgroups, or subgroups to individuals). We propose a set of statistical markers indicative of the paradox, and offer psychometric solutions for dealing with the paradox when encountered—including a toolbox in R for detecting Simpson's paradox. We show that explicit modeling of situations in which the paradox might occur not only prevents incorrect interpretations of data, but also results in a deeper understanding of what data tell us about the world.},

	abstract = {Estimation of causal effects of time-varying exposures using longitudinal data is a common problem in epidemiology. When there are time-varying confounders, which may include past outcomes, affected by prior exposure, standard regression methods can lead to bias. Methods such as inverse probability weighted estimation of marginal structural models have been developed to address this problem. However, in this paper we show how standard regression methods can be used, even in the presence of time-dependent confounding, to estimate the total effect of an exposure on a subsequent outcome by controlling appropriately for prior exposures, outcomes and time-varying covariates. We refer to the resulting estimation approach as sequential conditional mean models (SCMM), which can be fitted using generalised estimating equations. We outline this approach and describe how including propensity score adjustment is advantageous. We compare the causal effects being estimated using SCMMs and marginal structural models, and compare the two approaches using simulations. SCMMs enable more precise inferences, with greater robustness against model misspecification via propensity score adjustment, and easily accommodate continuous exposures and interactions. A new test for direct effects of past exposures on a subsequent outcome is described.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12874-015-0022-1},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Missing data are common in medical research, which can lead to a loss in statistical power and potentially biased results if not handled appropriately. Multiple imputation (MI) is a statistical method, widely adopted in practice, for dealing with missing data. Many academic journals now emphasise the importance of reporting information regarding missing data and proposed guidelines for documenting the application of MI have been published. This review evaluated the reporting of missing data, the application of MI including the details provided regarding the imputation model, and the frequency of sensitivity analyses within the MI framework in medical research articles.
METHODS: A systematic review of articles published in the Lancet and New England Journal of Medicine between January 2008 and December 2013 in which MI was implemented was carried out.
RESULTS: We identified 103 papers that used MI, with the number of papers increasing from 11 in 2008 to 26 in 2013. Nearly half of the papers specified the proportion of complete cases or the proportion with missing data by each variable. In the majority of the articles (86\%) the imputed variables were specified. Of the 38 papers (37\%) that stated the method of imputation, 20 used chained equations, 8 used multivariate normal imputation, and 10 used alternative methods. Very few articles (9\%) detailed how they handled non-normally distributed variables during imputation. Thirty-nine papers (38\%) stated the variables included in the imputation model. Less than half of the papers (46\%) reported the number of imputations, and only two papers compared the distribution of imputed and observed data. Sixty-six papers presented the results from MI as a secondary analysis. Only three articles carried out a sensitivity analysis following MI to assess departures from the missing at random assumption, with details of the sensitivity analyses only provided by one article.
CONCLUSIONS: This review outlined deficiencies in the documenting of missing data and the details provided about imputation. Furthermore, only a few articles performed sensitivity analyses following MI even though this is strongly recommended in guidelines. Authors are encouraged to follow the available guidelines and provide information on missing data and the imputation process.},

	abstract = {There is an ongoing debate in the medical community regarding the effects of testosterone on cardiovascular (CV) health. For decades, there has been conflicting evidence regarding the association of endogenous testosterone levels and CV disease (CVD) events that has resulted in much debate and confusion among health care providers and patients alike. Testosterone therapy has become increasingly widespread, and after the emergence of studies that reported increased CVD events in patients receiving testosterone therapy, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a warning statement about testosterone and its potential risk regarding CV health. Some of these studies were later found to be critically flawed, and some experts, including the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and an expert panel regarding testosterone deficiency and its treatment, reported that some of the FDA statements regarding testosterone therapy were lacking scientific evidence. This article summarizes the current evidence regarding the relationship between testosterone (endogenous and supplemental) and CV health. A literature review was conducted via search using PubMed and specific journal databases, including the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Key search terms included testosterone and cardiovascular health, coronary artery disease, heart failure, androgen deprivation therapy, intima-media thickness, and adrenal androgens. Initial study selection was limited to publications within the past 10 years (January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2016); however, key publications outside of this time frame were selected if they provided important quantitative data or historical perspectives for the review of this topic.

	abstract = {第一部分:基于基因表达谱的间变脑胶质瘤分子分型背景:既往在研究全级别脑胶质瘤(WHO II-IV级)或原发性胶质母细胞瘤(WHO IV级)分子分型方面,全基因组表达谱分析显示出了良好的稳定性与有效性,可用于揭示脑胶质瘤不同的细胞起源、预后差异及治疗敏感性差异。但是在间变性脑胶质瘤(WHO III级)分子分型方面,该方法尚未得到有效运用。方法:为了获得间变性脑胶质瘤的客观、可行的分子分型方案,我们在公共数据库中下载了三组相互独立的间变脑胶质瘤基因表达谱。通过联合应用单因素cox回归、线性结合危险评分及受试者工作特征曲线(ROC曲线),我们构建了具有最佳预后区分效果的基因标签。为了进一步解释不同分型预后差异的分子机制,我们继续应用了基因本体分析(Gene Ontology,GO),基因组变异分析(GSVA)及基因组富集分析(GSEA),用以揭示该分型相关的生物学功能。结果:本研究共收集到各平台的间变脑胶质瘤基因表达谱数据444例(CGGA数据库34例,GSE16011数据库80例,REMBRANDT数据库67例,TCGA数据库263例),通过上述分型标志物筛选方案,我们最终获得了基于三个基因的间变性脑胶质瘤分子分型方案。该方案可将间变性脑胶质瘤分为高危组和低危组,两组患者预后具有明显差异。从预后及分子遗传学特征上看,低危组患者与WHO II级患者类似,高危组患者与WHO IV级患者类似。高危组患者,其肿瘤更具侵袭性,遗传背景更复杂。结论:基于三个基因的分型方案可很好的区分患者临床预后。该高、低危患者与WHO IV级、II级患者具有一定一致性,提示需要给予不同的治疗方案。第二部分:磷酸化组蛋白H3在脑胶质瘤中的生物学意义背景:世界卫生组织(WHO)依照形态学特征,将脑胶质瘤分为不同的病理级别。但是,即使处于同一级别的肿瘤,其恶性度仍有较大差异。这提示我们要寻找更客观有效的指标,准确的判断肿瘤的恶性程度及生物学特征。磷酸化组蛋白H3(p HH3)是在多种体部肿瘤中广泛报道的生物标志物,在肿瘤细胞分裂期具有特征性表达。方法:为研究p HH3在脑胶质瘤中的预后价值及生物学功能,我们首先通过免疫组化方式,研究了61例间变脑胶质瘤中p HH3的表达趋势及预后意义。继而我们通过325例中国人群脑胶质瘤m RNA测序数据、169例美国TCGA中胶质母细胞瘤样本m RNA测序数据、305例中国人群脑胶质瘤m RNA芯片数据及603例美国TCGA中胶质母细胞瘤m RNA芯片数据,研究了p HH3及其相关基因在脑胶质瘤中的预后价值及生物学意义。最后,我们结合多因素cox回归及基因组富集分析(GSEA)等方法,进一步确证了上述研究结果。结果:p HH3蛋白表达水平、m RNA表达水平及p HH3相关基因在多个数据集中都被证实可预测患者预后。其表达水平较高者,预后较差。另外,在GSEA结果中,我们发现p HH3不仅与细胞周期相关,也与肿瘤的上皮间质转化密切相关。结论:p HH3及其相关基因可将脑胶质瘤分为两种不同的亚型。两种亚型的肿瘤具有截然不同的临床预后与生物学特征。第三部分:肿瘤细胞纯度在脑胶质瘤中的生物学意义背景:脑胶质瘤组织中不仅包含肿瘤细胞,还包含间质细胞、免疫细胞等非肿瘤细胞。这些非肿瘤细胞稀释了肿瘤细胞的纯度,对于构成肿瘤生存的微环境具有重要作用。目前,肿瘤细胞纯度这一指标在脑胶质瘤中的生物学意义尚未阐明。方法:我们收集了5个临床研究队列、2249例样本中的脑胶质瘤细胞纯度。依照5个研究队列中研究方法的不同,将RNA测序来源的数据(CGGA、TCGA RNA测序数据)作为发现组,m RNA芯片来源的数据(CGGA、TCGA、REMBRANDT、GSE16011 m RNA芯片数据)作为验证组。另将CGGA来源的肿瘤样本通过HE及免疫组化方法验证。结果:我们发现肿瘤细胞纯度与脑胶质瘤主要的临床及分子病理事件均显著相关。低纯度的样本多为高级别肿瘤、生存期较短。将肿瘤纯度纳入到预后预测模型中,可显著提高预测的准确度。在纳入肿瘤纯度这一指标后,目前已知的多个预后因素其效力明显降低,进一步验证了肿瘤纯度的重要生物学意义。另外,通过联合分析样本相关基因组学数据,我们发现了肿瘤细胞纯度相关的特征性基因组学变化,并发现低纯度的脑胶质瘤,更多的体现出免疫相关表型的的增强,特别是巨噬细胞、小胶质细胞和中性粒细胞相关表达谱的表达增强。联合预后分析,我们发现巨噬细胞及中性粒细胞表达谱的高低与预后相关。结论:肿瘤细胞纯度及肿瘤微环境中的非肿瘤细胞的比例与临床、基因组学特征等具有显著相关性,这对于脑胶质瘤精确分型与临床诊疗具有重要意义。},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Ethical guidelines for human subject research require that the burdens and benefits of participation be equally distributed. This study aimed to provide empirical data on exclusion of trial participants and reasons for this exclusion. As a secondary objective, we assessed to what extent exclusion affects generalizability of study results.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Review of trials on secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.
RESULTS: One hundred thirteen trials were identified, of which 112 reported exclusion criteria. One study justified the exclusion criteria applied. Ambiguous exclusion criteria due to the opinion of the physician (28 of 112 = 25\%) or physical disability (12 of 112 = 11\%) were reported. Within groups of trials that studied similar treatments (ie, beta-blocker, clopidogrel, or statin therapy), baseline characteristics differed among trials. For example, the proportion of women ranged between 23.1-47.4\%, 2.1-38.9\%, and 10.6-50.6\% for the clopidogrel, beta-blocker, and statin trials, respectively. Nevertheless, no evidence was found for heterogeneity of treatment effects.
CONCLUSION: Almost none of the articles justified the applied exclusion criteria. No evidence was found that inclusion of dissimilar participants affected generalizability. To allow for a normative discussion on equitable selection of study populations, researchers should not only report exclusion criteria but also the reasons for using these criteria.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Selective eligibility criteria of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are vital to trial feasibility and internal validity. However, the exclusion of certain patient populations may lead to impaired generalizability of results.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the nature and extent of exclusion criteria among RCTs published in major medical journals and the contribution of exclusion criteria to the representation of certain patient populations.
DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: The MEDLINE database was searched for RCTs published between 1994 and 2006 in certain general medical journals with a high impact factor. Of 4827 articles, 283 were selected using a series technique.
DATA EXTRACTION: Trial characteristics and the details regarding exclusions were extracted independently. All exclusion criteria were graded independently and in duplicate as either strongly justified, potentially justified, or poorly justified according to previously developed and pilot-tested guidelines.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Common medical conditions formed the basis for exclusion in 81.3\% of trials. Patients were excluded due to age in 72.1\% of all trials (60.1\% in pediatric populations and 38.5\% in older adults). Individuals receiving commonly prescribed medications were excluded in 54.1\% of trials. Conditions related to female sex were grounds for exclusion in 39.2\% of trials. Of all exclusion criteria, only 47.2\% were graded as strongly justified in the context of the specific RCT. Exclusion criteria were not reported in 12.0\% of trials. Multivariable analyses revealed independent associations between the total number of exclusion criteria and drug intervention trials (risk ratio, 1.35; 95\% confidence interval, 1.11-1.65; P = .003) and between the total number of exclusion criteria and multicenter trials (risk ratio, 1.26; 95\% confidence interval, 1.06-1.52; P = .009). Industry-sponsored trials were more likely to exclude individuals due to concomitant medication use, medical comorbidities, and age. Drug intervention trials were more likely to exclude individuals due to concomitant medication use, medical comorbidities, female sex, and socioeconomic status. Among such trials, justification for exclusions related to concomitant medication use and comorbidities were more likely to be poorly justified.
CONCLUSIONS: The RCTs published in major medical journals do not always clearly report exclusion criteria. Women, children, the elderly, and those with common medical conditions are frequently excluded from RCTs. Trials with multiple centers and those involving drug interventions are most likely to have extensive exclusions. Such exclusions may impair the generalizability of RCT results. These findings highlight a need for careful consideration and transparent reporting and justification of exclusion criteria in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Many clinicians report that they cannot read the medical literature critically. To address this difficulty, we provide a primer of clinical research for clinicians and researchers alike. Clinical research falls into two general categories: experimental and observational, based on whether the investigator assigns the exposures or not. Experimental trials can also be subdivided into two: randomised and non-randomised. Observational studies can be either analytical or descriptive. Analytical studies feature a comparison (control) group, whereas descriptive studies do not. Within analytical studies, cohort studies track people forward in time from exposure to outcome. By contrast, case-control studies work in reverse, tracing back from outcome to exposure. Cross-sectional studies are like a snapshot, which measures both exposure and outcome at one time point. Descriptive studies, such as case-series reports, do not have a comparison group. Thus, in this type of study, investigators cannot examine associations, a fact often forgotten or ignored. Measures of association, such as relative risk or odds ratio, are the preferred way of expressing results of dichotomous outcomes-eg, sick versus healthy. Confidence intervals around these measures indicate the precision of these results. Measures of association with confidence intervals reveal the strength, direction, and a plausible range of an effect as well as the likelihood of chance occurrence. By contrast, p values address only chance. Testing null hypotheses at a p value of 0.05 has no basis in medicine and should be discouraged.},

	abstract = {Background
To assist educators and researchers in improving the quality of medical research, we surveyed the editors and statistical reviewers of high-impact medical journals to ascertain the most frequent and critical statistical errors in submitted manuscripts.

Findings
The Editors-in-Chief and statistical reviewers of the 38 medical journals with the highest impact factor in the 2007 Science Journal Citation Report and the 2007 Social Science Journal Citation Report were invited to complete an online survey about the statistical and design problems they most frequently found in manuscripts. Content analysis of the responses identified major issues. Editors and statistical reviewers (n = 25) from 20 journals responded. Respondents described problems that we classified into two, broad themes: A. statistical and sampling issues and B. inadequate reporting clarity or completeness. Problems included in the first theme were (1) inappropriate or incomplete analysis, including violations of model assumptions and analysis errors, (2) uninformed use of propensity scores, (3) failing to account for clustering in data analysis, (4) improperly addressing missing data, and (5) power/sample size concerns. Issues subsumed under the second theme were (1) Inadequate description of the methods and analysis and (2) Misstatement of results, including undue emphasis on p-values and incorrect inferences and interpretations.

Conclusions
The scientific quality of submitted manuscripts would increase if researchers addressed these common design, analytical, and reporting issues. Improving the application and presentation of quantitative methods in scholarly manuscripts is essential to advancing medical research.},

Platelet thrombi that form in coronary and carotid arteries also underlie common vascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke and are the target of drugs used to treat these diseases. Birds have high-pressure cardiovascular systems like mammals but generate nucleated thrombocytes rather than platelets. Here, we show that avian thrombocytes respond to many of the same activating stimuli as mammalian platelets but are unable to form shear-resistant aggregates ex vivo. Avian thrombocytes are larger than mammalian platelets, spread less efficiently on collagen, and express much lower levels of the α(₂b)β₃ integrin required for aggregate formation, features predicted to make thrombocyte aggregates less resistant than platelets are to the high fluid shear forces of the arterial vasculature. In vivo carotid vessel injury stimulates the formation of occlusive platelet thrombi in mice but not in the size- and flow-matched carotid artery of the Australian budgerigar. These studies indicate that unique physical and molecular features of mammalian platelets enable them to form shear-resistant arterial thrombi, an essential element in the pathogenesis of human cardiovascular diseases.},

	abstract = {The baseline standards for minimally acceptable science are improving as the understanding of the scientific method improves. Journals publishing research papers are becoming more and more rigorous. For example, in 2001 a group of authors evaluated the quality of clinical trials in anesthesia published over a 20 year period [Pua et al., Anesthesiology 2001;95:1068–73]. The authors divided the time into 3 subgroups and analyzed and compared the quality assessment score from research papers in each group. The authors reported that the scientific quality scores increased significantly in this time, showing more randomization, sample size calculation and blinding of studies. Because every journal strives to have a high scientific impact factor, research quality is critical to this goal. This means novice researchers must study, understand and rigorously avoid the common mistakes described in this review. Failure to do so means the hundreds and hundreds of hours of effort it takes to conduct and write up a clinical trial will be for naught, in that the manuscript with be rejected or worse yet, ignored. All scientists have a responsibility to understand research methods, conduct the best research they can and publish the honest and unbiased results.},

Beside the role in cancer, partially shared with p53 and the other member p73, p63 also plays exclusive roles in development and homeostasis of ectodermal/epidermal-related organs. Here we show that p63 transcriptionally controls the expression of the matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13). p63 binds a p53-like responsive element in the human promoter of MMP13, thus promoting the activation of its transcription. The catalytic activity of MMP13 is required in high invasion capacity of metastatic cancer cells, however, although p63 and MMP13 expression correlates in cancer patients, their co-expression does not predict cancer patient survival. Our results demonstrate that p63 directly controls MMP13 expression.},

Several immunohistochemistry markers have been identified to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from HGDNs. However, sensitivity or specificity of the individual marker is still limited. In this study, we analyzed dynamic alteration of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and CD34 during hepatocarcinogenesis from dysplastic nodules to small HCC. The diagnostic performance of LIFR and CD34 combination in WD-HCC and HGDNs was investigated by logistic regression models and validated in an independent validation cohort. LIFR was decreased and CD34 was increased along with stepwise progression of hepatocarcinogenesis from low-grade dysplastic nodules (LGDNs) to small HCC. The sensitivity and specificity of the LIFR and CD34 combination for WD-HCC detection were 93.5\% and 90.5\%, respectively. In addition, colony formation assay was used to explore the role of LIFR in tumorigenesis. Silencing of LIFR could significantly promote colony formation of HCC cells, whereas ectopic overexpression of LIFR resulted in impaired ability of colony formation of HCC cells. These findings indicate that LIFR and CD34 combination may be used as an available differential diagnostic model for WD-HCC from HGDNs in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {In a previous paper, one of the authors (JBC) used a chi-squared method to analyse the means (SD) of baseline variables, such as height or weight, from randomised controlled trials by Fujii et al., concluding that the probabilities that the reported distributions arose by chance were infinitesimally small. Subsequent testing of that chi-squared method, using simulation, suggested that the method was incorrect. This paper corrects the chi-squared method and tests its performance and the performance of Monte Carlo simulations and ANOVA to analyse the probability of random sampling. The corrected chi-squared method and ANOVA method became inaccurate when applied to means that were reported imprecisely. Monte Carlo simulations confirmed that baseline data from 158 randomised controlled trials by Fujii et al. were different to those from 329 trials published by other authors and that the distribution of Fujii et al.'s data were different to the expected distribution, both p {\textless} 10−16. The number of Fujii randomised controlled trials with unlikely distributions was less with Monte Carlo simulation than with the 2012 chi-squared method: 102 vs 117 trials with p {\textless} 0.05; 60 vs 86 for p {\textless} 0.01; 30 vs 56 for p {\textless} 0.001; and 12 vs 24 for p {\textless} 0.00001, respectively. The Monte Carlo analysis nevertheless confirmed the original conclusion that the distribution of the data presented by Fujii et al. was extremely unlikely to have arisen from observed data. The Monte Carlo analysis may be an appropriate screening tool to check for non-random (i.e. unreliable) data in randomised controlled trials submitted to journals.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Vitamin D supplementation is suggested to reduce the risk of falls among ambulatory or institutionalized elderly subjects. The present study was undertaken to address the reduced risk of falls and hip fractures in patients with long-standing stroke by vitamin D supplementation.
METHODS: Ninety-six elderly women with poststroke hemiplegia were followed for two years. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two groups, and 48 patients received 1,000 IU ergocalciferol daily, and the remaining 48 received placebo. The number of falls per person and incidence of hip fractures were compared between the two groups. Strength and tissue ATPase of skeletal muscles on the nonparetic side were assessed before and after the study.
RESULTS: At baseline, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were in the deficient range ({\textless}10 ng/ml) in all patients; and vitamin D treatment enhanced serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. Vitamin D treatment accounted for a 59\% reduction in falls (95\% CI, 28-81\%; p = 0.003). There were increases in the relative number and size of type II muscle fibers and improved muscle strength in the vitamin D-treated group. Hip fractures occurred in 4 of 48 placebo group and 0 in 48 vitamin D2 group during the 2-year study period (log-rank, p = 0.049).
CONCLUSION: Vitamin D may increase muscle strength by improving atrophy of type II muscle fibers, which may lead to decreased falls and hip fractures.},

The purpose of the present study was to clarify the efficacy of interventions intended to prevent hip fractures in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease. PubMed was used to search the literature for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding Parkinson's disease and hip fractures. The inclusion criteria were 50 or more subjects per group and a study period of 1 year or longer. Five RCTs were identified and the relative risk and 95\% confidence interval were calculated for individual RCTs. Sunlight exposure increased serum hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration, improved motor function, decreased bone resorption and increased BMD. Alendronate or risedronate with vitamin D supplementation increased serum 25(OH)D concentration, strongly decreased bone resorption and increased BMD. Menatetrenone (vitamin K(2)) decreased serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin concentration, decreased bone resorption and increased BMD. Sunlight exposure (men and women), menatetrenone (women), alendronate and risedronate with vitamin D supplementation (women) significantly reduced the incidence of hip fractures. The respective RRs (95\% confidence intervals) according to the intention-to-treat analysis were 0.27 (0.08, 0.96), 0.13 (0.02, 0.97), 0.29 (0.10, 0.85) and 0.20 (0.06, 0.68).

	volume = {28},
	issn = {0039-2499},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been demonstrated that bone mass was significantly reduced on the hemiplegic side of stroke patients, which might increase their risk of hip fracture. We evaluated the efficacy of 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 [1 alpha (OH)D3] and supplemental elemental calcium in maintaining bone mass and decreasing the incidence of hip fractures after hemiplegic stroke.
METHODS: In a randomized study, 64 patients with hemiplegia after stroke with a mean duration of illness of 4.8 years received either 1 microgram 1 alpha (OH)D3 daily (treatment group, n = 30) or an inactive placebo (placebo group, n = 34) for 6 months and were observed for this duration. Both groups received 300 mg of elemental calcium daily. The bone mineral density (BMD) and metacarpal index (MCI) in the second metacarpals were determined by computed x-ray densitometry. The incidence of hip fractures in these patients was recorded.
RESULTS: BMD on the hemiplegic side decreased by 2.4\% in the treatment group and 8.9\% in the placebo group (P = .0021), while BMD on the intact side increased by 3.5\% and decreased by 6.3\% in the treated and placebo groups, respectively (P = .0177). In the treatment group, the difference in BMD between hemiplegic and nonhemiplegic sides decreased significantly compared with that before randomization. This difference increased in the placebo group. We observed a similar improvement in MCI in the treatment group but not in the placebo group. Four patients in the placebo group suffered a hip fracture compared with none in the treatment group (P = .0362).
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with 1 alpha (OH)D3 and supplemental elemental calcium can reduce the risk of hip fractures and can prevent further decreases in BMD and MCI on the hemiplegic side of patients with a long-standing stroke. Treatment also may improve these indices on the intact side.},

Before the treatment 21 patients (31\%) of untreated and 20 patients (30\%) of treated group met electrophysiologic criteria for CTS. Sensory impairment of the nonparetic side had lessened in the treated group. After 2 years, all electrophysiologic indices of nonparetic side were significantly improved in the treated group compared with those in the untreated group. The improvement from baseline of electrophysiologic parameters in sensory nerve in the treated group was greater than the improvement measured in motor nerve. There were no side effects. Oral mecobalamin treatment is a safe and potentially beneficial therapy for CTS in stroke patients.},

The purpose of the present study was to clarify the efficacy of oral bisphosphonates for preventing hip fracture in disabled patients with such neurological diseases.
METHODS: A literature search (PubMed) was done from 1995 to the present for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and a meta-analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: Seven RCTs met the criteria, including two of etidronate (ALS and stroke), two of alendronate (stroke and Parkinson's disease), and three of risedronate (stroke and Parkinson's disease). All of the RCTs were performed on Japanese patients. According to the results of pooled data analysis, the relative risk (95\% confidence interval) of hip fracture in patients receiving etidronate, alendronate, and risedronate treatment compared with placebo or active control treatment was 0.16 (0.03-0.87), 0.29 (0.10-0.80), and 0.24 (0.10-0.58), respectively, suggesting a reduction of risk by more than 70\% with oral bisphosphonates. There was no statistical evidence of heterogeneity among RCTs, and publication bias was not identified by the funnel plot and Begg's rank correlation test. No severe adverse events due to oral bisphosphonate treatment were reported.
LIMITATION: It remains uncertain whether the findings are relevant for Western patients with an increased risk of hip fracture due to neurological diseases.
CONCLUSION: A meta-analysis of RCTs suggested that oral bisphosphonate treatment prevents hip fracture in disabled Japanese patients with neurological diseases, including ALS, stroke, and Parkinson's disease. Oral bisphosphonate treatment was well tolerated by such patients.},

The purpose of the present study was to clarify the efficacy of risedronate against hip fracture in patients with neurological diseases.
METHODS: The literature was searched with PubMed from 1995 to the present, with respect to strictly conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with narrow confidence intervals (CIs), and a meta-analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: Four RCTs met the criteria; one RCT for Alzheimer's disease (n = 461, mean age = 78 years), two RCTs for stroke (n = 267, mean age = 76 years for men; n = 345, mean age = 71 years for women), and one RCT for Parkinson's disease (n = 223, mean age = 71 years). According to the results of RCTs, the relative risks (95\% CI) for hip fracture with risedronate treatment compared with placebo treatment were 0.26 (0.10, 0.69) for Alzheimer's disease, 0.20 (0.04, 0.89) for stroke in men, 0.14 (0.02, 1.16) for stroke in women, and 0.34 (0.09, 1.21) for Parkinson's disease. Overall, the relative risk (95\% CI) for hip fracture with risedronate treatment was 0.25 (0.13, 0.48), suggesting 75\% of risk reduction rate with risedronate treatment in patients with one of the three neurological diseases (heterogeneity: 0.58, p = 0.9016 and overall effect: 17.36, p {\textless} 0.0001).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Minodronate is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate that is commercially available for the treatment of osteoporosis in Japan. Preclinical studies demonstrated that minodronate is at least 10 times more potent than alendronate in inhibiting bone resorption in vivo. A high incidence of fractures, particularly of the hip, represents an important problem in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients who are prone to falls and may have osteoporosis.
METHODS: A total of 256 elderly patients with AD were assigned to daily treatment with 1.0 mg of minodronate or a daily treatment with risedronate combined with daily 1000 IU ergocalciferol and 1200 mg elemental calcium, and followed up for 12 months.
RESULTS: At baseline, patients of both groups showed low 25-hydroxyvitamin D with compensatory hyperparathyroidism. Non-vertebral fractures occurred in 5 patients in the minodronate group and 7 patients in the risedronate group (5 hip fractures; one fracture each at the distal forearm and pelvis). There was no difference in risk of hip fracture between the two groups (p=.70; odds ratio=0.8).
CONCLUSIONS: The study medications were well tolerated with relatively few adverse events and were equivalent in reducing the risk of a fracture in elderly patients with AD.},

In this double-blind, randomized, and prospective study of 98 patients with hemiplegia involving both an upper and lower extremity (55 males and 53 females; mean age, 71.4 +/- 0.6 years) after an acute stroke, 49 were given etidronate for 56 weeks and 49 received a placebo. The BMD was measured by computed X-ray densitometry (CXD) of the second metacarpal bone bilaterally. Forty age-matched control subjects were followed for 56 weeks. At baseline, both groups had 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] insufficiency, increased serum ionized calcium and pyridinoline cross-linked carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP), and low serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], suggesting immobilization-induced hypercalcemia and inhibition of renal synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D. The BMD on the hemiplegic side decreased by 2.3\% and 4.8\% in the etidronate and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.0003). After treatment, the serum 1,25(OH)2D concentration increased by 62.2\% in the etidronate group and decreased by 12.4\% in the placebo group. The etidronate group had significant decreases in the serum ionized calcium and ICTP and increases in PTH and bone Gla protein (BGP), whereas the placebo group had higher serum calcium and ICTP concentrations but stable PTH. These results suggest that etidronate can prevent decreases in the BMD in hemiplegic stroke patients because it decreases the serum calcium through inhibition of bone resorption and causes a subsequent increase in the serum 1,25(OH)2D concentration.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of risedronate in reducing the severity of osteoporosis and in decreasing the risk of hip fractures in elderly women following an acute stroke.
METHODS: This was a 12-month, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. In a prospective study of stroke patients, 187 patients received a daily dose of 2.5 mg risedronate for 12 months, and the remaining 187 received placebo.

Eleven patients sustained fractures in the sunlight-deprived group, and three fractures occurred among the sunlight-exposed group (p = 0.0362; odds ratio = 3.7).
INTRODUCTION: A high incidence of fractures, particularly of the hip, represents an important problem in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), who are prone to falls and have osteoporosis. We previously showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) deficiency caused by sunlight deprivation with compensatory hyperparathyroidism causes reduced BMD in elderly women with AD. This study was undertaken to address the possibility that sunlight exposure with calcium supplementation may maintain BMD and reduce the incidence of nonvertebral fractures in elderly women with AD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a random and prospective study, AD patients were assigned to regular sunlight exposure (n = 132) or sunlight deprivation (n = 132) and followed for 1 year. BMD of the second metacarpal bone was measured using a computed X-ray densitometer (CXD). The CXD method measures BMD and cortical thickness at the middle of the second metacarpal bone on a radiogram of the hand and an aluminum step wedge as a standard (20 steps; 1 mm/step). Incidence of nonvertebral fractures in the two patient groups during the 1-year follow-up period was assessed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: At baseline, average hospitalization period was 1.7 years in both groups, and activity of daily living (ADL) was decreased. Patients of both groups showed vitamin D deficiency caused by sunlight deprivation and decreased dietary intake of vitamin D with compensatory hyperparathyroidism. The exposed group patients were exposed to sunlight (3615 minutes/year).

Serum 25-OHD level increased from 24.0 to 52.2 nM in the sunlight-exposed group. Eleven patients sustained fractures in the sunlight-deprived group, and three fractures occurred among the sunlight-exposed group (p = 0.0362; odds ratio = 3.7). Sunlight exposure can increase the BMD of vitamin D-deficient bone by increasing 25-OHD concentration and lead to the prevention of nonvertebral fractures.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Stroke increases the risk of subsequent hip fracture by 2 to 4 times. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for both ischemic stroke and osteoporotic fractures in elderly men and women. Treatment with folate and mecobalamin (vitamin B12) may improve hyperhomocysteinemia.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether treatment with folate and vitamin B12 reduces the incidence of hip fractures in patients with hemiplegia following stroke.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A double-blind, randomized controlled study of 628 consecutive patients aged 65 years or older with residual hemiplegia at least 1 year following first ischemic stroke, who were recruited from a single Japanese hospital from April 1, 2000, to May 31, 2001. Patients were assigned to daily oral treatment with 5 mg of folate and 1500 microg of mecobalamin, or double placebo; 559 completed the 2-year follow-up.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of hip fractures in the 2 patient groups during the 2-year follow-up.
RESULTS: At baseline, patients in both groups had high levels of plasma homocysteine and low levels of serum cobalamin and serum folate. After 2 years, plasma homocysteine levels decreased by 38\% in the treatment group and increased by 31\% in the placebo group (P{\textless}.001). The number of hip fractures per 1000 patient-years was 10 and 43 for the treatment and placebo groups, respectively (P{\textless}.001). The adjusted relative risk, absolute risk reduction, and the number needed to treat for hip fractures in the treatment vs placebo groups were 0.20 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.08-0.50), 7.1\% (95\% CI, 3.6\%-10.8\%), and 14 (95\% CI, 9-28), respectively. No significant adverse effects were reported.
CONCLUSION: In this Japanese population with a high baseline fracture risk, combined treatment with folate and vitamin B12 is safe and effective in reducing the risk of a hip fracture in elderly patients following stroke.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Incidence of a fracture, particularly in the hip joint, is high in Parkinson's disease (PD), owing to the immobilisation-induced bone resorption and vitamin D deficiency with reduced bone mineral density (BMD). The authors previously demonstrated the lowered incidence of hip fractures in PD by daily administration of risedronate and vitamin D.
METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to determine the efficacy of 17.5 mg once-weekly risedronate in the prevention of hip fracture in women with PD. Patients were randomly assigned to 17.5 mg risedronate once a week (n=136) or a placebo (n=136) combined with daily 1000 IU of ergocalciferol. Incidence of hip fractures was compared between the two groups during the 2-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Hip fractures occurred in 15 patients in the placebo group and 3 patients in the risedronate group. The RR for hip fractures in the risedronate group as compared with the placebo group was 0.20 (95\% CI 0.06 to 0.66). In the risedronate group, serum calcium levels decreased during the follow-up, while the levels in the placebo group increased. BMD increased by 3.4\% in the risedronate group and decreased by 3.2\% in the placebo group (p{\textless}0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with once-weekly risedronate and ergocalciferol prevents hip fractures in older women with PD.},

AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of methylprednisolone pulse therapy compared to placebo in PD patients with NMS.
METHODS: In a double blind, placebo controlled study, 20 PD patients with NMS received steroid pulse therapy for three days, and 20 PD patients received placebo. Both groups received levodopa, bromocriptine, and dantrolene.
RESULTS: NMS in the steroid group healed within 10 days in 17 patients; median value of duration of illness of NMS in this group was 7 days (range 4-20). NMS in the placebo group healed within 10 days in five patients; in the remaining 15, it persisted for 12-27 days after the onset of NMS; median value of duration illness of NMS in this group was 18 days. Hyperthermia, rigidity, and consciousness improved within 10 days in many patients in the steroid group; these signs persisted more than 10 days in many patients in the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS: Steroid pulse therapy is useful in NMS for reducing the illness duration and improving symptoms.},

	volume = {66},
	issn = {0022-3050},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A high prevalence of hip and other fractures in elderly patients with Parkinson's disease has been linked to reduced bone mass arising from a defect of renal synthesis of 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1, 25-[OH]2D). Treatment with 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha(OH)D3; an active form of vitamin D) was evaluated for maintaining bone mass and reducing the incidence of hip and other nonvertebral fractures in patients with Parkinson's disease.
METHODS: In a double blind, randomised trial, 86 elderly patients with Parkinson's disease (mean Hoehn and Yahr stage, 3; mean age 70.6 years) were randomised to receive either 1 microg 1alpha(OH)D3 daily (treatment group, n=43) or a placebo (n=43) for 18 months. Bone mineral densities in the second metacarpals were determined by computed radiographic densitometry. Serum bone turnover indices were measured serially, and incidence of nonvertebral fractures was recorded.
RESULTS: Bone mineral densities decreased 1.2\% in the treatment group compared with 6.7\% in the placebo group during 18 months (p{\textless}0.0001). At baseline in both groups, the serum concentration of 1, 25-[OH]2D was reduced. Parathyroid hormone was abnormally increased in 15 patients (17\%) and correlated negatively with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, indicating compensatory hyperparathyroidism. Eight patients sustained fractures (six at the hip and two at other sites) in the placebo group, and one hip fracture occurred among treated patients (odds ratio 9.8; p=0.0028).
CONCLUSION: By increasing serum 1, 25-[OH]2D concentrations, treatment with 1alpha(OH)D3 can reduce the risk of hip and other non-vertebral fractures in osteoporotic elderly patients with Parkinson's disease by slowing the loss of bone mineral densities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Statistical techniques can investigate data integrity in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We systematically reviewed and analyzed all human RCTs undertaken by a group of researchers, about which concerns have been raised.
METHODS: We compared observed distributions of p values for between-groups differences in baseline variables, for standardized sample means for continuous baseline variables, and for differences in treatment group participant numbers with the expected distributions. We assessed productivity, recruitment rates, outcome data, textual consistency, and ethical oversight.
RESULTS: The researchers were remarkably productive, publishing 33 RCTs over 15 years involving large numbers of older patients with substantial comorbidity, recruited over very short periods. Treatment groups were improbably similar. The distribution of p values for differences in baseline characteristics differed markedly from the expected uniform distribution (p = 5.2 × 10-82). The distribution of standardized sample means for baseline continuous variables and the differences between participant numbers in randomized groups also differed markedly from the expected distributions (p = 4.3 × 10-4, p = 1.5 × 10-5, respectively). Outcomes were remarkably positive, with very low mortality and study withdrawals despite substantial comorbidity. There were very large reductions in hip fracture incidence, regardless of intervention (relative risk 0.22, 95\% confidence interval 0.15-0.31, p {\textless} 0.0001, range of relative risk 0.10-0.33), that greatly exceed those reported in meta-analyses of other trials. There were multiple examples of inconsistencies between and within trials, errors in reported data, misleading text, duplicated data and text, and uncertainties about ethical oversight.
CONCLUSIONS: A systematic approach using statistical techniques to assess randomization outcomes can evaluate data integrity, in this case suggesting these RCT results may be unreliable.},

	abstract = {Significant reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) occurs in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), correlating with immobilization and with vitamin D deficiency, and increasing the risk of hip fracture, especially in elderly women. As a biological indicator of compromised vitamin K status, an increased serum concentration of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Oc) has been associated with reduced BMD in the hip and an increased risk of fracture in otherwise healthy elderly women. We evaluated treatment with vitamin K(2) (menatetrenone; MK-4) in maintaining BMD and reducing the incidence of nonvertebral fractures in elderly female patients with PD. In a random and prospective study of PD patients, 60 received 45 mg of MK-4 daily for 12 months, and the remaining 60 (untreated group) did not. At baseline, patients of both groups showed vitamin D and K(1) deficiencies, high serum levels of ionized calcium, and glutaminic residue (Glu) Oc, and low levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)(2)D], indicating that immobilization-induced hypercalcemia inhibits renal synthesis of 1,25-(OH)(2)D and compensatory PTH secretion. BMD in the second metacarpals increased by 0.9\% in the treated group and decreased by 4.3\% in the untreated group (p {\textless} 0.0001). Vitamin K(2) level increased by 259.8\% in the treated group. Correspondingly, significant decreases in Glu Oc and calcium were observed in the treated group, in association with an increase in both PTH and 1,25-(OH)(2)D. Ten patients sustained fractures (eight at the hip and two at other sites) in the untreated group, and one hip fracture occurred among treated patients (p = 0.0082; odds ratio = 11.5). The treatment with MK-4 can increase the BMD of vitamin D- and K-deficient bone by increasing vitamin K concentration, and it can also decrease calcium levels through inhibition of bone resorption, resulting in an increase in 1,25-(OH)(2)D concentration.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

How to apply key study design principles to next generation sequencing (NGS) can be unclear and is sometimes overlooked by researchers who are new to this technology. A proper study design in NGS studies can be achieved with awareness of factors that can influence sequencing results and by taking the necessary steps to limit their biasing assessment. These steps include using simultaneously or similarly sequenced controls, randomising, determining the necessary sequencing depth, and performing a power calculation to determine the necessary sample size for testing hypotheses at significance levels adjusted for multiple comparisons. Applying study design principles to NGS studies will increase the likelihood of identifying genetic factors associated with human traits and diseases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization refers to an analytic approach to assess the causality of an observed association between a modifiable exposure or risk factor and a clinically relevant outcome. It presents a valuable tool, especially when randomized controlled trials to examine causality are not feasible and observational studies provide biased associations because of confounding or reverse causality. These issues are addressed by using genetic variants as instrumental variables for the tested exposure: the alleles of this exposure-associated genetic variant are randomly allocated and not subject to reverse causation. This, together with the wide availability of published genetic associations to screen for suitable genetic instrumental variables make Mendelian randomization a time- and cost-efficient approach and contribute to its increasing popularity for assessing and screening for potentially causal associations. An observed association between the genetic instrumental variable and the outcome supports the hypothesis that the exposure in question is causally related to the outcome. This review provides an overview of the Mendelian randomization method, addresses assumptions and implications, and includes illustrative examples. We also discuss special issues in nephrology, such as inverse risk factor associations in advanced disease, and outline opportunities to design Mendelian randomization studies around kidney function and disease.},

However, it is unclear whether this association reflects causal processes. We used 185 common variants recently mapped for plasma lipids (P {\textless} 5 × 10(-8) for each) to examine the role of triglycerides in risk for CAD. First, we highlight loci associated with both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels, and we show that the direction and magnitude of the associations with both traits are factors in determining CAD risk. Second, we consider loci with only a strong association with triglycerides and show that these loci are also associated with CAD. Finally, in a model accounting for effects on LDL-C and/or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, the strength of a polymorphism's effect on triglyceride levels is correlated with the magnitude of its effect on CAD risk. These results suggest that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins causally influence risk for CAD.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Genetic studies might provide new insights into the biological
mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism and risk of CAD. We therefore
conducted a genome-wide association study to identify novel genetic
determinants of LDL-c, HDL-c and triglycerides.

Methods and results
We combined genome-wide association data from eight studies,
comprising up to 17,723 participants with information on circulating lipid
concentrations. We did independent replication studies in up to 37,774
participants from eight populations and also in a population of Indian Asian
descent. We also assessed the association between SNPs at lipid loci and
risk of CAD in up to 9,633 cases and 38,684 controls., We identified four novel genetic loci that showed reproducible
associations with lipids (P values 1.6 × 10−8 to
3.1 × 10−10). These include a potentially
functional SNP in the SLC39A8 gene for HDL-c, a SNP near
the MYLIP/GMPR and PPP1R3B genes for LDL-c
and at the AFF1 gene for triglycerides. SNPs showing strong
statistical association with one or more lipid traits at the
CELSR2, APOB,
APOE-C1-C4-C2 cluster, LPL,
ZNF259-APOA5-A4-C3-A1 cluster and
TRIB1 loci were also associated with CAD risk (P values
1.1 × 10−3 to 1.2 ×
10−9).

Conclusions
We have identified four novel loci associated with circulating
lipids. We also show that in addition to those that are largely associated
with LDL-c, genetic loci mainly associated with circulating triglycerides
and HDL-c are also associated with risk of CAD. These findings potentially
provide new insights into the biological mechanisms underlying lipid
metabolism and CAD risk.},

	abstract = {Finding individual-level data for adequately-powered Mendelian randomization analyses may be problematic. As publicly-available summarized data on genetic associations with disease outcomes from large consortia are becoming more abundant, use of published data is an attractive analysis strategy for obtaining precise estimates of the causal effects of risk factors on outcomes. We detail the necessary steps for conducting Mendelian randomization investigations using published data, and present novel statistical methods for combining data on the associations of multiple (correlated or uncorrelated) genetic variants with the risk factor and outcome into a single causal effect estimate. A two-sample analysis strategy may be employed, in which evidence on the gene-risk factor and gene-outcome associations are taken from different data sources. These approaches allow the efficient identification of risk factors that are suitable targets for clinical intervention from published data, although the ability to assess the assumptions necessary for causal inference is diminished. Methods and guidance are illustrated using the example of the causal effect of serum calcium levels on fasting glucose concentrations. The estimated causal effect of a 1 standard deviation (0.13 mmol/L) increase in calcium levels on fasting glucose (mM) using a single lead variant from the CASR gene region is 0.044 (95 \% credible interval -0.002, 0.100). In contrast, using our method to account for the correlation between variants, the corresponding estimate using 17 genetic variants is 0.022 (95 \% credible interval 0.009, 0.035), a more clearly positive causal effect.},

	abstract = {Mendelian randomization is a popular technique for assessing and estimating the causal effects of risk factors. If genetic variants which are instrumental variables for a risk factor are shown to be additionally associated with a disease outcome, then the risk factor is a cause of the disease. However, in many cases, the instrumental variable assumptions are not plausible, or are in doubt. In this paper, we provide a theoretical classification of scenarios in which a causal conclusion is justified or not justified, and discuss the interpretation of causal effect estimates. A list of guidelines based on the ‘Bradford Hill criteria’ for judging the plausibility of a causal finding from an applied Mendelian randomization study is provided. We also give a framework for performing and interpreting investigations performed in the style of Mendelian randomization, but where the choice of genetic variants is statistically, rather than biologically motivated. Such analyses should not be assigned the same evidential weight as a Mendelian randomization investigation. We discuss the role of such investigations (in the style of Mendelian randomization), and what they add to our understanding of potential causal mechanisms. If the genetic variants are selected solely according to statistical criteria, and the biological roles of genetic variants are not investigated, this may be little more than what can be learned from a well-designed classical observational study.},

The core functionality is to implement the inverse-variance weighted, MR-Egger and weighted median methods for multiple genetic variants. Several options are available to the user, such as the use of robust regression, fixed- or random-effects models and the penalization of weights for genetic variants with heterogeneous causal estimates. Extensions to these methods, such as allowing for variants to be correlated, can be chosen if appropriate. Graphical commands allow summarized data to be displayed in an interactive graph, or the plotting of causal estimates from multiple methods, for comparison. Although the main method of data entry is directly by the user, there is also an option for allowing summarized data to be incorporated from the PhenoScanner database of genotype-phenotype associations.

	abstract = {Importance: In observational studies, abdominal adiposity has been associated with type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease (CHD). Whether these associations represent causal relationships remains uncertain.
Objective: To test the association of a polygenic risk score for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) adjusted for body mass index (BMI), a measure of abdominal adiposity, with type 2 diabetes and CHD through the potential intermediates of blood lipids, blood pressure, and glycemic phenotypes.
Design, Setting, and Participants: A polygenic risk score for WHR adjusted for BMI, a measure of genetic predisposition to abdominal adiposity, was constructed with 48 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The association of this score with cardiometabolic traits, type 2 diabetes, and CHD was tested in a mendelian randomization analysis that combined case-control and cross-sectional data sets. Estimates for cardiometabolic traits were based on a combined data set consisting of summary results from 4 genome-wide association studies conducted from 2007 to 2015, including up to 322 154 participants, as well as individual-level, cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank collected from 2007-2011, including 111 986 individuals. Estimates for type 2 diabetes and CHD were derived from summary statistics of 2 separate genome-wide association studies conducted from 2007 to 2015 and including 149 821 individuals and 184 305 individuals, respectively, combined with individual-level data from the UK Biobank.
Exposures: Genetic predisposition to increased WHR adjusted for BMI.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Type 2 diabetes and CHD.
Results: Among 111 986 individuals in the UK Biobank, the mean age was 57 (SD, 8) years, 58 845 participants (52.5\%) were women, and mean WHR was 0.875. Analysis of summary-level genome-wide association study results and individual-level UK Biobank data demonstrated that a 1-SD increase in WHR adjusted for BMI mediated by the polygenic risk score was associated with 27-mg/dL higher triglyceride levels, 4.1-mg/dL higher 2-hour glucose levels, and 2.1-mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (each P {\textless} .001). A 1-SD genetic increase in WHR adjusted for BMI was also associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, 1.77 [95\% CI, 1.57-2.00]; absolute risk increase per 1000 participant-years, 6.0 [95\% CI, CI, 4.4-7.8]; number of participants with type 2 diabetes outcome, 40 530) and CHD (odds ratio, 1.46 [95\% CI, 1.32-1.62]; absolute risk increase per 1000 participant-years, 1.8 [95\% CI, 1.3-2.4]; number of participants with CHD outcome, 66 440).
Conclusions and Relevance: A genetic predisposition to higher waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. These results provide evidence supportive of a causal association between abdominal adiposity and these outcomes.},

We provide a meta-epidemiological overview of the methodological approaches used in MR studies, and evaluate the discussion of MR assumptions and reporting of statistical methods.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase and Web of Science for MR studies up to December 2013. We assessed (i) the MR approach used; (ii) whether the plausibility of MR assumptions was discussed; and (iii) whether the statistical methods used were reported adequately.
RESULTS: Of 99 studies using data from one study population, 32 used genetic information as a proxy for the exposure without further estimation, 44 performed a formal IV analysis, 7 compared the observed with the expected genotype-outcome association, and 1 used both the latter two approaches. The 80 studies using data from multiple study populations used many different approaches to combine the data; 52 of these studies used some form of IV analysis; 44\% of studies discussed the plausibility of all three MR assumptions in their study. Statistical methods used for IV analysis were insufficiently described in 14\% of studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Most MR studies either use the genotype as a proxy for exposure without further estimation or perform an IV analysis. The discussion of underlying assumptions and reporting of statistical methods for IV analysis are frequently insufficient. Studies using data from multiple study populations are further complicated by the combination of data or estimates. We provide a checklist for the reporting of MR studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The term Mendelian randomization is popular in the current literature. The first aim of this work is to describe the idea of Mendelian randomization studies and the assumptions required for drawing valid conclusions. The second aim is to contrast Mendelian randomization and path modeling when different 'omics' levels are considered jointly.
METHODS: We define Mendelian randomization as introduced by Katan in 1986, and review its crucial assumptions. We introduce path models as the relevant additional component to the current use of Mendelian randomization studies in 'omics'. Real data examples for the association between lipid levels and coronary artery disease illustrate the use of path models.
RESULTS: Numerous assumptions underlie Mendelian randomization, and they are difficult to be fulfilled in applications. Path models are suitable for investigating causality, and they should not be mixed up with the term Mendelian randomization. In many applications, path modeling would be the appropriate analysis in addition to a simple Mendelian randomization analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Mendelian randomization and path models use different concepts for causal inference. Path modeling but not simple Mendelian randomization analysis is well suited to study causality with different levels of 'omics' data.},

	doi = {10.1093/ije/dyv080},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy).
METHODS: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias. Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger's test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables.
RESULTS: We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples.
CONCLUSIONS: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.},

	volume = {4},
	issn = {2047-9980},
	doi = {10.1161/JAHA.114.001652},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of the CYP2C19 genotype on clopidogrel efficacy has been studied widely, with data suggesting reduced clopidogrel efficacy in loss-of-function variant carriers taking clopidogrel after percutaneous coronary intervention; however, data are limited regarding the association between CYP2C19 genetic variants and outcomes in stroke patients. We investigated whether CYP2C19 metabolizer status affects the risk of recurrent stroke or major bleeding in subcortical stroke patients taking dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel.
METHODS AND RESULTS: CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*17 were genotyped in 522 patients treated with dual antiplatelet therapy from the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) study. CYP2C19 metabolizer status was inferred from genotype, and associations with the risk of recurrent stroke and major bleeding were assessed in the overall cohort and by race/ethnic group with logistic regression modeling. In the overall cohort, there were no differences in outcomes by CYP2C19 metabolizer status (recurrent stroke, odds ratio 1.81 [95\% CI 0.76 to 4.30]; major bleeding, odds ratio 0.67 [95\% CI 0.22 to 2.03]). In white participants, those with CYP2C19 intermediate or poor metabolizer status had higher odds of recurrent stroke (odds ratio 5.19 [95\% CI 1.08 to 24.90]) than those with extensive or ultrarapid metabolizer status, but there was no evidence of difference in major bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in recurrent stroke by CYP2C19 genotype-inferred metabolizer status in white subcortical stroke patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, consistent with cardiovascular studies on CYP2C19 and clopidogrel; however, the bleeding risk that led to early termination of the antiplatelet arm of the SPS3 trial does not appear to be explained by CYP2C19 genotype. This study was relatively underpowered; therefore, these findings should be interpreted with caution and warrant replication.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We hypothesized that concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6), serum amyloid A, tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 1, CD40 ligand, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 would predict recurrent ischemic stroke and major vascular events after recent lacunar stroke.
METHODS: Levels of Inflammatory Markers in the Treatment of Stroke (LIMITS) was an international, multicenter, prospective ancillary biomarker study nested within the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) study, a Phase III trial in patients with recent lacunar stroke. Crude and Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) for recurrence risks.
RESULTS: Among 1244 patients with lacunar stroke (mean age, 63.3±10.8 years), there were 115 major vascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death). The risk of major vascular events increased with elevated concentrations of both tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 1 (adjusted HR per SD, 1.21; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.41; P=0.01) and IL-6 (adjusted HR per SD, 1.10; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.19; P=0.008). Compared with the bottom quartile (tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 1 {\textless}2.24 ng/L), those in the top quartile of tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 1 ({\textgreater}3.63 ng/L) were at twice the risk of major vascular events after adjusting for demographics (partially adjusted HR, 1.98; 95\% CI, 1.11-3.52), though the effect attenuated after adjusting for other risk factors and statin use (adjusted HR, 1.68; 95\% CI, 0.93-3.04). Serum amyloid A, CD40 ligand, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were not associated with prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Among recent lacunar stroke patients, IL-6 and TNF receptor concentrations predict risk of recurrent vascular events, and they are associated with the effect of antiplatelet therapies.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in lacunar stroke patients in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) trial and to assess their relationship with recurrent stroke and death, and response to assigned treatment.
METHODS: SPS3 is a randomized, clinical trial conducted between 2003 and 2011. Patients with recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-documented lacunar infarcts were randomly assigned in a factorial design to target levels of systolic blood pressure (130-149mmHg vs {\textless}130mmHg; open label) and to antiplatelet treatment (aspirin/clopidogrel vs aspirin/placebo; double-blinded). The current analysis involves 1,278 trial participants who had a baseline axial T2*-weighted gradient echo MRI sequence allowing for CMB detection.
RESULTS: CMBs were present in 30\% of 1,278 patients (mean age = 63 years). Male gender (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-2.3), history of hypertension (OR = 1.6, 95\% CI = 1.2-2.3), increased systolic blood pressure (1.2 per 20mmHg, 95\% CI = 1.1-1.4), nondiabetic status (OR = 1.4, 95\% CI = 1.1-1.9), multiple old lacunar infarcts (OR = 1.9, 95\% CI = 1.5-2.5), and moderate (OR = 1.7, 95\% CI = 1.2-2.3) or severe (OR = 4.2, 95\% CI = 3.0-5.9) white matter hyperintensities on MRI were independently associated with CMBs. During a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, overall stroke recurrence was 2.5\% per patient-year. Patients with CMBs had an adjusted 2-fold increased risk of recurrent stroke (hazard ratio = 2.1, 95\% CI = 1.4-3.1). CMBs were not a risk factor for death. There were no statistically significant interactions between CMBs and treatment assignments.
INTERPRETATION: Patients with lacunar stroke and CMBs likely harbor a more advanced form of cerebral small vessel disease in need of efficacious therapeutic strategies. Ann Neurol 2017;82:196-207.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose
Infarct size and location are thought to correlate with different mechanisms of lacunar infarcts. We examined the relationship between the size and shape of lacunar infarcts and vascular risk factors and outcomes.

Methods
We studied 1679 participants in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Stroke trial with a lacunar infarct visualized on DWI. Infarct volume was measured planimetrically, and shape was classified based on visual analysis after 3D reconstruction of axial MRI slices.

Results
Infarct shape was ovoid/spheroid in 63\%, slab 12\%, stick 7\%, and multi- component 17\%. Median infarct volume was smallest in ovoid/spheroid relative to other shapes: 0.46, 0.65, 0.54, and 0.90 ml respectively, p{\textless} 0.001. Distributions of vascular risk factors were similar across the four groups except that patients in the ovoid/spheroid and stick groups were more often diabetic and those with multi-component had significantly higher blood pressure at study entry. Intracranial stenosis did not differ among groups (p=0.2). Infarct volume was not associated with vascular risk factors. Increased volume was associated with worse functional status at baseline and 3 months. Overall, 162 recurrent strokes occurred over an average of 3.4 years of follow-up with no difference in recurrent ischemic stroke rate by shape or volume.

Conclusion
In patients with recent lacunar stroke, vascular risk factor profile was similar amongst the different infarct shapes and sizes. Infarct size correlated with worse short- term functional outcome. Neither shape nor volume was predictive of stroke recurrence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging manifestations of small vessel disease are heterogeneous, and correlation with patient features has not been adequately characterized.
AIM: Our goal was to correlate magnetic resonance imaging findings with clinical features in a large multiethnic cohort with recent lacunar stroke.
METHODS: Patient characteristics were correlated with neuroimaging results in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Stroke study participants.
RESULTS: Among 3005 patients, mean age was 63 years; 62\% were men; and 51\%, 30\%, and 16\% were non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, and Black, respectively. Recent lacunar infarcts were distributed between the subcortical hemisphere (31\%), thalamus (26\%), brainstem/cerebellum (26\%), and basal ganglia/internal capsule (16\%). Multiple lacunar infarcts (i.e., acute and remote) were present in 40\% and associated with increased age (OR 1·3 per 20 years, 95\% CI 1·1, 1·5), male gender (OR 1·5, CI 1·3, 1·7), hypertension (OR 1·5, CI 1·2, 1·8), increased systolic blood pressure (OR 1·2 per 20 mmHg, CI 1·1, 1·3), and prior stroke (OR 3·8, CI 2·9, 5·0). Moderate-severe white matter hyperintensities were present in 50\% and associated with increased age (OR 4·3 per 20 years, CI 3·4, 5·4), hypertension (OR 1·8, CI 1·4, 2·3), increased systolic blood pressure (OR 1·3 per 20 mmHg, CI 1·1, 1·5), increased diastolic blood pressure (OR 1·2 per 10 mm, CI 1·0, 1·3), and prior stroke (OR 3·3, CI 2·3, 4·5). Infarct location varied significantly by race-ethnicity (P {\textless} 0·001), with Blacks and Hispanics having more infarcts in the brainstem/cerebellum than non-Hispanic Whites, and by gender with women more often having thalamic lacunes than men (P ≤ 0·001).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recent lacunar stroke, infarct location and number have distinctie associations with gender, vascular risk factors, and race-ethnicity, demonstrating the complex pathogenesis of lacunar stroke and cerebral small artery disease.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose
Diabetes is an independent risk factor for lacunar strokes. Few data are available regarding patient features, infarct location, and recurrent vascular events for diabetic patients with lacunar stroke.

Methods
We compared features at study entry and prognosis during 3.6 years of follow-up of diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients with recent lacunar stroke participating in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) randomized trial.

Results
Among the 3020 participants, the prevalence of diabetes was 37\% with a mean duration of 11 years. Diabetes was independently associated with slightly younger age (63 years vs. 64 years, p{\textless}0·001), Hispanic ethnicity (36\% vs. 28\%, p{\textless}0·0001), ischemic heart disease (11\% vs. 6\%, p=0·002), and peripheral vascular disease (5\% vs. 2\%, p{\textless}0·001). Diabetic patients more frequently had intracranial stenosis ≥50\% (p{\textless}0·001), infarcts involving the brainstem or cerebellum (p{\textless}0·001), and more extensive white matter abnormalities (p{\textless}0·001). Diabetic patients were almost twice as likely to have a recurrent stroke (HR 1·8; 95\% CI 1·4–2·3), recurrent ischemic stroke (HR 1·8; 95\% CI 1·4–2·4), disabling/fatal stroke (HR 1·8; 95\% CI 1·2–2·9), myocardial infarction (HR 1·7; 95\% CI 1·0–2·8) and death (HR 2·1 (95\% CI 1·6–2·8) compared with non-diabetics.

Conclusions
Diabetic patients with lacunar stroke have a distinctive clinical profile that includes double the prevalence of systemic and intracranial atherosclerosis, preferential involvement of the posterior circulation, and a poor prognosis for recurrent stroke and death.},

Among participants in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes randomized trial, we sought to identify patients with high vs. low rates of recurrent ischemic stroke and to assess effects of aggressive blood pressure control and dual antiplatelet therapy according to risk status.

Methods
Multivariable analyses of 3020 participants with recent MRI-defined lacunar strokes followed for a mean of 3.7 years with 243 recurrent ischemic strokes. Results: Prior symptomatic lacunar stroke or TIA (HR 2.2, 95\%CI 1.6,2.9), diabetes (HR 2.0, 95\%CI 1.5,2.5), Black race (HR 1.7, 95\%CI 1.3,2.3) and male sex (HR 1.5, 95\%CI 1.1,1.9) were each independently predictive of recurrent ischemic stroke. Recurrent ischemic stroke occurred at a rate of 4.3\%/yr (95\% CI 3.3, 5.5) in patients with prior symptomatic lacunar stroke or TIA (15\% of the cohort), 3.1\%/yr (95\%CI 2.6, 3.9) in those with {\textgreater}1 of the other 3 risk factors (27\% of the cohort), and 1.3\%/yr (95\%CI 1.0,1.7) in those with 0 to 1 risk factors (58\% of the cohort). There were no significant interactions between treatment effects and stroke risk status.

Conclusions
In this large, carefully followed cohort of patients with recent lacunar stroke and aggressive blood pressure management, prior symptomatic lacunar ischemia, diabetes, Black race and male sex independently predicted ischemic stroke recurrence. The effects of blood pressure targets and dual antiplatelet therapy were similar across the spectrum of independent risk factors and recurrence risk.},

	abstract = {Background
Lacunar infarcts are a frequent type of stroke caused mainly by cerebral small-vessel disease. The effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention has not been defined.

Methods
We conducted a double-blind, multicenter trial involving 3020 patients with recent symptomatic lacunar infarcts identified by magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 75 mg of clopidogrel or placebo daily; patients in both groups received 325 mg of aspirin daily. The primary outcome was any recurrent stroke, including ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage.

Results
The participants had a mean age of 63 years, and 63\% were men. After a mean follow-up of 3.4 years, the risk of recurrent stroke was not significantly reduced with aspirin and clopidogrel (dual antiplatelet therapy) (125 strokes; rate, 2.5\% per year) as compared with aspirin alone (138 strokes, 2.7\% per year) (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.16), nor was the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.63 to 1.09) or disabling or fatal stroke (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95\% CI, 0.69 to 1.64). The risk of major hemorrhage was almost doubled with dual antiplatelet therapy (105 hemorrhages, 2.1\% per year) as compared with aspirin alone (56, 1.1\% per year) (hazard ratio, 1.97; 95\% CI, 1.41 to 2.71; P{\textless}0.001). Among classifiable recurrent ischemic strokes, 71\% (133 of 187) were lacunar strokes. All-cause mortality was increased among patients assigned to receive dual antiplatelet therapy (77 deaths in the group receiving aspirin alone vs. 113 in the group receiving dual antiplatelet therapy) (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95\% CI, 1.14 to 2.04; P = 0.004); this difference was not accounted for by fatal hemorrhages (9 in the group receiving dual antiplatelet therapy vs. 4 in the group receiving aspirin alone).

Conclusions
Among patients with recent lacunar strokes, the addition of clopidogrel to aspirin did not significantly reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and did significantly increase the risk of bleeding and death.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Lowering blood pressure (BP) prevents stroke, however optimal target levels of blood reduction to prevent stroke recurrence are lacking. We hypothesized that targeting systolic BP of {\textless}130 mmHg would reduce stroke recurrence in patients with recent lacunar stroke.

METHODS
The Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) was a multi-center international trial, involving 3020 patients with recent symptomatic MRI-defined lacunar infarcts randomized to two target levels of systolic BP: a) higher group 130–149 mm Hg vs. b) lower group {\textless}130 mm Hg, and followed for a mean of 3.7 years. The primary outcome was all recurrent stroke (including ischemic strokes and intracranial hemorrhages). The study is registered, NCT 00059306.

FINDINGS
Mean participant age was 63 years; after 1 year mean systolic BP was 138 mm Hg (95\% CI 137 to 139) in the higher group and 127 mm Hg (95\% CI, 126 to 128) in the lower group. At last study visit, the difference in systolic BP between groups averaged 11 mm Hg (±SD 16). The annualized rate of recurrent stroke in the higher target group was 2.77\% (n=152) compared with 2.25\% (n=125) in the lower target group (HR 0.81, 95\% CI 0.64, 1.03, p-value 0.08). Similar trends were observed for reductions in disabling/fatal stroke (HR 0.81, 95\%CI 0.53, 1.23, p-value 0.32) and in the composite outcome of stroke, myocardial infarct or vascular death (HR 0.84, 95\%CI 0.68,1.01, p-value 0.10). Intracerebral hemorrhage was reduced by 63\% in those assigned to the lower target group (HR 0.37 95\% CI, 0.14, 0.89, p-value 0.03). Serious complications of BP lowering were in frequent, and not significantly different in frequency between groups.

INTERPRETATION
In patients with recent lacunar stroke, targeting asystolic BP of{\textless} 130 mm Hg did not significantly reduce all stroke, but markedly reduced intracerebral hemorrhage. The lower target was safe and well tolerated.},

	abstract = {Background
Little is known about post-stroke depression in patients with lacunar stroke due to cerebral small vessel disease. Our objectives were to describe the prevalence of depression, its correlates and to examine the course of depression over time in a cohort of patients with lacunar stroke, the majority of whom had mild functional disability.

Methods
Depression was determined in participants in the international Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) trial which is testing antiplatelet therapies and targets of blood pressure control in patients with lacunar strokes and assessing stroke recurrence and cognitive decline. Depression was evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to examine the relationship between the covariates of interest and depression. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the likelihood of depression over time, while accounting for the multiple measurements within each subject.

Results
The prevalence of depression in 2,477 participants at approximately 4 months after stroke was 19\%. Older age (OR 0.97; 95\% CI 0.96–0.99), male gender (OR 0.62; 95\% CI 0.48–0.80) and less cognitive impairment (OR 0.99; 95\% CI 0.98–1.00) were independently associated with a lower risk of depression. Functional disability (OR 1.8; 95\% CI 1.3–2.4), living with a spouse/family (OR 1.6; 95\% CI 1.1–2.3) and risk factors for stroke (OR 1.2; 95\% CI 1.0–1.3) were each independently associated with a higher risk of depression. Longitudinal modeling indicated that the likelihood of depression decreased by 1.12 times (95\% CI 1.06–1.17) for each 1-year increase in time.

Conclusions
One fifth of those in the SPS3 trial cohort reported depression that is sustained over time. Although this is lower than the prevalence reported for stroke in general, these results underscore the importance of early screening for post-stroke depression, treatment and follow-up to minimize the negative consequences associated with depression.},

METHODS: For this cross-sectional analysis, participants were categorized by baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) {\textless} 120, 120-139, 140-159, 160-179, and ≥ 180 mm Hg and compared on demographic and clinical characteristics. Predictors of SBP {\textless} 140 mm Hg were examined.
RESULTS: Mean SBP was 143±19 mm Hg while receiving an average of 1.7 antihypertensive medications; SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg for 53\% and ≥ 160 mm Hg for 18\% of the 3,020 participants. Higher SBP was associated with a history of hypertension and hypertension for longer duration (both P {\textless} 0.0001). Higher SBPs were associated with more extensive white matter disease on magnetic resonance imaging (P {\textless} 0.0001). There were significant differences in entry-level SBP when participants were categorized by race and region (both P {\textless} 0.0001). Black participants were more likely to have SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg. Multivariable logistic regression showed an independent effect for region with those from Canada more likely (odds ratio = 1.7; 95\% confidence interval, 1.29, 2.32) to have SBP {\textless} 140 mm Hg compared with participants from United States.

The SPS3 trial enrolled patients who experienced a symptomatic small subcortical stroke (lacunar stroke) within the previous 6 months and an eligible lesion on detected on magnetic resonance imaging. The patients were randomized, in a factorial design, to antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 325 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily vs aspirin 325 mg daily plus placebo) and to one of two levels of systolic blood pressure targets ("intensive" [{\textless}130 mmHg] or "usual" [130-149 mmHg]).

	doi = {10.1016/S1473-3099(16)30116-5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Australia introduced a national quadrivalent human papillomavirus (4vHPV) vaccination programme for girls and young women in April, 2007. The HPV genotypes targeted by the female vaccine could also affect the protection afforded to heterosexual men. We examined the prevalence of 4vHPV targeted vaccine genotypes and the nine-valent HPV (9vHPV)-targeted vaccines genotypes among sexually active, predominantly unvaccinated heterosexual men from 2004 to 2015.
METHODS: We did a retrospective, observational study of urine and urethral swab specimens from heterosexual men aged 25 years or younger attending the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre between July 1, 2004, and June 30, 2015, who tested positive for Chlamydia trachomatis. We extracted HPV DNA and used the PapType HPV assay to detect 14 high-risk HPV genotypes (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68) and two low-risk genotypes (6 and 11). We calculated the prevalence of any HPV genotype, genotypes 6 or 11, genotypes 16 or 18, genotypes in the 4vHPV group (6, 11, 16, or 18), five additional genotypes in the 9vHPV group (31, 33, 45, 52, or 58), and non-vaccine-targeted genotypes (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 56, 58, 59, 66, or 68).
FINDINGS: We obtained data between July 1, 2004, and June 30, 2015, and did the data analysis in December, 2015. Of 1764 specimens obtained, we included 1466 in our final analysis (the others were excluded because they had indeterminate results or were duplicates). The prevalence of any HPV genotype and genotypes 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 did not change from 2004-05 to 2014-15, but we noted reductions in genotypes 6 and 11 (from 12\% [95\% CI 6-21\%], to 3\% [1-7\%], ptrend=0·008), 16 and 18 (from 13\% [95\% CI 7-22\%] to 3\% [1-6\%], ptrend{\textless}0·0001), and 4vHPV-targeted genotypes (from 22\% [95\% CI 14-33\%] to 6\% [3-10\%], ptrend{\textless}0·0001). Prevalence of non-vaccine-targeted genotypes increased from 16\% [95\% CI 9-26\%] to 22\% [17-29\%], ptrend{\textless}0·0001). In Australian-born men, 4vHPV-targeted genotype prevalence decreased from 11 of 55 [20\%, 95\% CI 10-33\%] to two of 74 [3\%, 0-11\%], ptrend{\textless}0·0001); an even greater decline occurred in Australian-born men aged 21 years or younger (from four of 13 [31\%, 95\% CI 9-61\%] to none of 25; ptrend{\textless}0·0001). Genotypes 16 and 18 decreased (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR] 0·32, 95\% CI 0·14-0·74; p=0·008) but not genotypes 6 and 11 (adjusted PR 0·50, 0·16-1·56; p=0·234) in the postvaccination period among men who had arrived in Australia within 2 years from countries with a bivalent vaccine (2vHPV) programme (England, Scotland, Wales, Cook Islands, Northern Ireland, or the Netherlands), compared with the prevaccination period. No change was noted in 4vHPV genotypes in men born overseas in other countries.
INTERPRETATION: The marked reduction in prevalence of 4vHPV genotypes among mainly unvaccinated Australian-born men suggests herd protection has occurred from the female vaccination programme. Additionally, the decline in genotypes 16 and 18, but not genotypes 6 and 11, among overseas-born men predominantly from countries with a 2vHPV vaccine programme suggests that these men received benefits from herd protection for genotypes 16 and 18 from their vaccinated female partners in their own countries. These reductions could translate to reductions in HPV-related malignant conditions in men, even in countries with female-only vaccination programmes.

Two prophylactic HPV vaccines that target the two most oncogenic virus types, HPV16 and HPV18, are now commercially available. In controlled clinical trials, the vaccines proved to be effective at preventing incident anogenital infection and the associated neoplastic disease that is induced by these virus types. Here, we highlight the specific aspects of HPV biology and vaccine composition that are likely to contribute to the efficacy of these vaccines, and we discuss how these particular features might or might not be relevant for the development of effective vaccines against other sexually transmitted viruses such as HIV and herpes simplex virus (HSV).},

Age at onset has been used as a quantitative phenotype in genetic analysis looking for Huntington's disease modifiers, but is hard to define and not always available. Therefore, we aimed to generate a novel measure of disease progression and to identify genetic markers associated with this progression measure.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We generated a progression score on the basis of principal component analysis of prospectively acquired longitudinal changes in motor, cognitive, and imaging measures in the 218 indivduals in the TRACK-HD cohort of Huntington's disease gene mutation carriers (data collected 2008–11). We generated a parallel progression score using data from 1773 previously genotyped participants from the European Huntington's Disease Network REGISTRY study of Huntington's disease mutation carriers (data collected 2003–13). We did a genome-wide association analyses in terms of progression for 216 TRACK-HD participants and 1773 REGISTRY participants, then a meta-analysis of these results was undertaken.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Longitudinal motor, cognitive, and imaging scores were correlated with each other in TRACK-HD participants, justifying use of a single, cross-domain measure of disease progression in both studies. The TRACK-HD and REGISTRY progression measures were correlated with each other (r=0·674), and with age at onset (TRACK-HD, r=0·315; REGISTRY, r=0·234). The meta-analysis of progression in TRACK-HD and REGISTRY gave a genome-wide significant signal (p=1·12 × 10$^{\textrm{−10}}$) on chromosome 5 spanning three genes: \textit{MSH3, DHFR}, and \textit{MTRNR2L2}. The genes in this locus were associated with progression in TRACK-HD (\textit{MSH3} p=2·94 × 10$^{\textrm{−8}}$ \textit{DHFR} p=8·37 × 10$^{\textrm{−7}}$ MTRNR2L2 p=2·15 × 10$^{\textrm{−9}}$) and to a lesser extent in REGISTRY (\textit{MSH3} p=9·36 × 10$^{\textrm{−4}}$ \textit{DHFR} p=8·45 × 10$^{\textrm{−4}}$ \textit{MTRNR2L2} p=1·20 × 10$^{\textrm{−3}}$). The lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TRACK-HD (rs557874766) was genome-wide significant in the meta-analysis (p=1·58 × 10$^{\textrm{−8}}$), and encodes an aminoacid change (Pro67Ala) in MSH3. In TRACK-HD, each copy of the minor allele at this SNP was associated with a 0·4 units per year (95\% CI 0·16–0·66) reduction in the rate of change of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Total Motor Score, and a reduction of 0·12 units per year (95\% CI 0·06–0·18) in the rate of change of UHDRS Total Functional Capacity score. These associations remained significant after adjusting for age of onset.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The multidomain progression measure in TRACK-HD was associated with a functional variant that was genome-wide significant in our meta-analysis. The association in only 216 participants implies that the progression measure is a sensitive reflection of disease burden, that the effect size at this locus is large, or both. Knockout of \textit{Msh3} reduces somatic expansion in Huntington's disease mouse models, suggesting this mechanism as an area for future therapeutic investigation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The European Commission FP7 NeurOmics project; CHDI Foundation; the Medical Research Council UK; the Brain Research Trust; and the Guarantors of Brain.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Access to primary research data is vital for the advancement of science. To extend the data types supported by community repositories, we built a prototype Image Data Resource (IDR) that collects and integrates imaging data acquired across many different imaging modalities. IDR links data from several imaging modalities, including high-content screening, super-resolution and time-lapse microscopy, digital pathology, public genetic or chemical databases, and cell and tissue phenotypes expressed using controlled ontologies. Using this integration, IDR facilitates the analysis of gene networks and reveals functional interactions that are inaccessible to individual studies. To enable re-analysis, we also established a computational resource based on Jupyter notebooks that allows remote access to the entire IDR. IDR is also an open source platform that others can use to publish their own image data. Thus IDR provides both a novel on-line resource and a software infrastructure that promotes and extends publication and re-analysis of scientific image data.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Stroke and TIA are recognized complications of acute herpes zoster (HZ). Herein, we evaluate HZ as a risk factor for cerebrovascular disease (stroke and TIA) and myocardial infarction (MI) in a UK population cohort.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 106,601 HZ cases and 213,202 controls, matched for age, sex, and general practice, was identified from the THIN (The Health Improvement Network) general practice database. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the risks of stroke, TIA, and MI in cases and controls, adjusted for vascular risk factors, including body mass index {\textgreater}30 kg/m(2), smoking, cholesterol {\textgreater}6.2 mmol/L, hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, intermittent arterial claudication, carotid stenosis, and valvular heart disease, over 24 (median 6.3) years after HZ infection.
RESULTS: Risk factors for vascular disease were significantly increased in cases of HZ compared with controls. Adjusted hazard ratios for TIA and MI but not stroke were increased in all patients with HZ (adjusted hazard ratios [95\% confidence intervals]: 1.15 [1.09-1.21] and 1.10 [1.05-1.16], respectively). However, stroke, TIA, and MI were increased in cases whose HZ occurred when they were younger than 40 years (adjusted hazard ratios [95\% confidence intervals]: 1.74 [1.13-2.66], 2.42 [1.34-4.36], and 1.49 [1.04-2.15], respectively). Subjects younger than 40 years were significantly less likely to be asked about vascular risk factors compared with older patients (p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSION: HZ is an independent risk factor for vascular disease in the UK population, particularly for stroke, TIA, and MI in subjects affected before the age of 40 years. In older subjects, better ascertainment of vascular risk factors and earlier intervention may explain the reduction in risk of stroke after HZ infection.},

Software applying machine learning has become an essential tool to automate analysis, but these methods require annotated examples to learn from. Efficiently exploring large datasets to find relevant examples remains a challenging bottleneck. Here, we present Advanced Cell Classifier (ACC), a graphical software package for phenotypic analysis that addresses these difficulties. ACC applies machine-learning and image-analysis methods to high-content data generated by large-scale, cell-based experiments. It features methods to mine microscopic image data, discover new phenotypes, and improve recognition performance. We demonstrate that these features substantially expedite the training process, successfully uncover rare phenotypes, and improve the accuracy of the analysis. ACC is extensively documented, designed to be user-friendly for researchers without machine-learning expertise, and distributed as a free open-source tool at www.cellclassifier.org.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer risk is strongly associated with an intergenic region on 11q13. We have previously shown that the strongest risk-associated SNPs fall within a distal enhancer that regulates CCND1. Here, we report that, in addition to regulating CCND1, this enhancer regulates two estrogen-regulated long noncoding RNAs, CUPID1 and CUPID2. We provide evidence that the risk-associated SNPs are associated with reduced chromatin looping between the enhancer and the CUPID1 and CUPID2 bidirectional promoter. We further show that CUPID1 and CUPID2 are predominantly expressed in hormone-receptor-positive breast tumors and play a role in modulating pathway choice for the repair of double-strand breaks. These data reveal a mechanism for the involvement of this region in breast cancer.},

The present study establishes a widely prevalent mechanism of resistance to gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer, whereby increased glycolytic flux leads to glucose addiction in cancer cells and a corresponding increase in pyrimidine biosynthesis to enhance the intrinsic levels of deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP). Increased levels of dCTP diminish the effective levels of gemcitabine through molecular competition. We also demonstrate that MUC1-regulated stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) mediates such metabolic reprogramming. Targeting HIF-1α or de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, in combination with gemcitabine, strongly diminishes tumor burden. Finally, reduced expression of TKT and CTPS, which regulate flux into pyrimidine biosynthesis, correlates with better prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients on fluoropyrimidine analogs.},

The localization of condensin at chromosome arms is crucial for chromosome partitioning during anaphase. Condensin is also enriched at kinetochores but its precise role and loading machinery remain unclear. Here we show that fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) kinetochore proteins Pcs1 and Mde4--homologues of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) monopolin subunits and known to prevent merotelic kinetochore orientation--act as a condensin 'recruiter' at kinetochores, and that condensin itself may act to clamp microtubule binding sites during metaphase. In addition to the regional recruitment factors, overall condensin association with chromatin is governed by the chromosomal passenger kinase Aurora B. Aurora-B-dependent phosphorylation of condensin promotes its association with histone H2A and H2A.Z, which we identify as conserved chromatin 'receptors' of condensin. Condensin phosphorylation and its deposition onto chromosome arms reach a peak during anaphase, when Aurora B kinase relocates from centromeres to the spindle midzone, where the separating chromosome arms are positioned. Our results elucidate the molecular basis for the spatiotemporal regulation of mitotic chromosome architecture, which is crucial for chromosome partitioning.},

It is largely unknown what defines the inner centromere and how the CPC is targeted to this site. Here, we show that the phosphorylation of histone H3-threonine 3 (H3-pT3) mediated by Haspin cooperates with Bub1-mediated histone 2A-serine 121 (H2A-S121) phosphorylation in targeting the CPC to the inner centromere in fission yeast and human cells. H3-pT3 promotes nucleosome binding of survivin, whereas phosphorylated H2A-S121 facilitates the binding of shugoshin, the centromeric CPC adaptor. Haspin colocalizes with cohesin by associating with Pds5, whereas Bub1 localizes at kinetochores. Thus, the inner centromere is defined by intersection of two histone kinases.},

	abstract = {The centromere of a chromosome is composed mainly of two domains, a kinetochore assembling core centromere and peri-centromeric heterochromatin regions. The crucial role of centromeric heterochromatin is still unknown, because even in simpler unicellular organisms such as the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the heterochromatin protein Swi6 (HP1 homologue) has several functions at centromeres, including silencing gene expression and recombination, enriching cohesin, promoting kinetochore assembly, and, ultimately, preventing erroneous microtubule attachment to the kinetochores. Here we show that the requirement of heterochromatin for mitotic chromosome segregation is largely replaced by forcibly enriching cohesin at centromeres in fission yeast. However, this enrichment of cohesin is not sufficient to replace the meiotic requirement for heterochromatin. We find that the heterochromatin protein Swi6 associates directly with meiosis-specific shugoshin Sgo1, a protector of cohesin at centromeres. A point mutation of Sgo1 (V242E), which abolishes the interaction with Swi6, impairs the centromeric localization and function of Sgo1. The forced centromeric localization of Sgo1 restores proper meiotic chromosome segregation in swi6 cells. We also show that the direct link between HP1 and shugoshin is conserved in human cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that the recruitment of shugoshin is the important primary role for centromeric heterochromatin in ensuring eukaryotic chromosome segregation.},

	abstract = {Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a major trait of cancer cells and a potent driver of tumor progression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CIN still remain elusive. We found that a number of CIN(+) cell lines have impairments in the integrity of the conserved inner centromere-shugoshin (ICS) network, which coordinates sister chromatid cohesion and kinetochore-microtubule attachment. These defects are caused mostly by the loss of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation at centromeres and sometimes by a reduction in chromatin-associated cohesin; both pathways separately sustain centromeric shugoshin stability. Artificial restoration of the ICS network suppresses chromosome segregation errors in a wide range of CIN(+) cells, including RB- and BRCA1-deficient cells. Thus, dysfunction of the ICS network might be a key mechanism underlying CIN in human tumorigenesis.},

EBM's initial focus was on educating clinicians in the understanding and use of published literature to optimise clinical care, including the science of systematic reviews. EBM progressed to recognise limitations of evidence alone, and has increasingly stressed the need to combine critical appraisal of the evidence with patient's values and preferences through shared decision making. In another progress, EBM incorporated and further developed the science of producing trustworthy clinical practice guidelines pioneered by investigators in the 1980s. EBM's enduring contributions to clinical medicine include placing the practice of medicine on a solid scientific basis, the development of more sophisticated hierarchies of evidence, the recognition of the crucial role of patient values and preferences in clinical decision making, and the development of the methodology for generating trustworthy recommendations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Under the influence of testicular secretion, the male vocal cords increase in length by 67\% in adult men compared with prepubertal boys, whereas in the female the increase is only 24\%. This greater length and an increase in vocal cord mass is responsible for the lowering of pitch of the male voice during puberty. From the late 16th century, castration was carried out in Italy to preserve the unbroken male voice into adult life, but the high pitch was accompanied by fully grown resonating chambers and a large thoracic capacity, giving rise to the unique voice of the castrato. The initial stimulus for the production of castrati came from the Sistine Chapel in Rome, to provide singers for the complex church music of the time. The second reason was the coming of opera to Italy at the beginning of the 17th century. Boys were castrated between the ages of 7 and 9 years, and underwent a long period of voice training. A small number became international opera stars, of whom the most famous was Farinelli, whose voice ranged over three octaves. By the end of the 18th century, fashions in opera had changed so that the castrati declined except in the Vatican, where the Sistine Chapel continued to employ castrati until 1903. The last of the castrati was Alessandro Moreschi, who died in 1924 and made gramophone recordings that provide the only direct evidence of a castrato's singing voice.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The phenomenon of castration is very closely associated with the baroque era. In a period that placed emphasis on pure sensual pleasure, castrati singers, with their angelic voices, were a perverted outcome of this ambition. It was the intention that these castrato voices with their supernatural sound would mesmerize audiences. At that time, it could be said that within certain society circles, an addiction to these voices existed. Equally, they were oblivious to the spiritual side of the lives of the castrati. Farinelli, Caffarelli, and Senesino, three of the most famous castrati, were the first musical superstars of the 18th century. Their voices moved decadent audiences to tears and standing ovations. The price for this fame was, however, high.
AIM: The aim of this review is to provide an overview of castrati singers, especially in the baroque era, their sexuality and the effects of castration on their physical development.
METHODS: A literature search of relevant databases, books, and articles in journals was performed and compared with current data concerning androgen suppression and endocrine aspects of male sexual dysfunction.
RESULTS: The effects of castration on physical development were notoriously erratic. Much depended on the timing of the operation: boys pruned before the age of 10 or so very often grew up with feminine features; smooth, hairless bodies, incipient breasts, infantile penis, and often a complete lack of sex drive.
CONCLUSION: The peak success of the castrati ended with the end of the 18th century. The last castrato was Alessandro Moreschi, a solo singer in the choir of the Sistine Chapel of the Vatican. Following the ban on castration, Pope Pius X sent him into retirement in 1912, thus putting an end to a very impressive part of the history of music.},

	abstract = {It is well established that male rat reproductive behaviors including sexual arousal, motivation, and performance are dependent on circulating levels of testosterone (T). The present study was designed to (1) compare the relative amount of T required to restore these different aspects of behavior in castrated rats, and (2) create an animal model for clinical populations with sexual impairments. Twenty-nine male Long-Evans rats were tested before and after castration for sexual performance (copulation), motivation (partner preference), and arousal (50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations; measured together with scent marking). Sexual arousal was also inferred from copulation data. Rats were then assigned to one of four groups, and T was re-introduced via Silastic capsule implants varying in length and content: No T (empty capsules), Low T (2mm capsules), Medium T (5mm capsules), or High T (two 10mm capsules). The highest dose was intended to restore physiological levels. Results indicate that High T is required for 50 kHz vocalizations, while Medium T was sufficient for the restoration of copulation, partner preference, and scent marking. These data suggest that sexual arousal may be most sensitive to reductions in testosterone. The role of T levels in measures of generalized and specific (sexual) arousal is discussed in the context of other reproductive behaviors. Furthermore, because the Low T group showed impairments across all behaviors during post-implant tests, we propose that these animals may provide a good animal model for studying clinical conditions marked by reduced motivation and arousal, including Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder.},

	abstract = {The hypothalamus is most often associated with innate behaviors such as is hunger, thirst and sex. While the expression of these behaviors important for survival of the individual or the species is nested within the hypothalamus, the desire (i.e., motivation) for them is centered within the mesolimbic reward circuitry. In this review, we will use female sexual behavior as a model to examine the interaction of these circuits. We will examine the evidence for a hypothalamic circuit that regulates consummatory aspects of reproductive behavior, i.e., lordosis behavior, a measure of sexual receptivity that involves estradiol membrane-initiated signaling in the arcuate nucleus (ARH), activating β-endorphin projections to the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN), which in turn modulate ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) activity-the common output from the hypothalamus. Estradiol modulates not only a series of neuropeptides, transmitters and receptors but induces dendritic spines that are for estrogenic induction of lordosis behavior. Simultaneously, in the nucleus accumbens of the mesolimbic system, the mating experience produces long term changes in dopamine signaling and structure. Sexual experience sensitizes the response of nucleus accumbens neurons to dopamine signaling through the induction of a long lasting early immediate gene. While estrogen alone increases spines in the ARH, sexual experience increases dendritic spine density in the nucleus accumbens. These two circuits appear to converge onto the medial preoptic area where there is a reciprocal influence of motivational circuits on consummatory behavior and vice versa. While it has not been formally demonstrated in the human, such circuitry is generally highly conserved and thus, understanding the anatomy, neurochemistry and physiology can provide useful insight into the motivation for sexual behavior and other innate behaviors in humans.},

	abstract = {The laboratory rat is an important, if neglected, actor in the history of sexuality. From the 1920s and 1940s, a series of reports emerged from American psychology laboratories detailing instances of spontaneous "reversals" in sexual behavior within their rat colonies. Frank Beach, then at the American Museum of Natural History, developed a model for the "nature" of sexuality that stressed that all organisms had the neurological capacity to perform behavior of either sex. Beach enrolled his emerging specialty, behavioral endocrinology, in support of Alfred Kinsey's controversial findings. Both scientists highlighted the multitude of potential sexual outlets pursued by organisms and the prevalence of nonprocreative sexual behaviors. This article draws on elements of queer theory to elucidate how the landscape of the comparative psychologist's rat colony with its organisms, apparatus, practices, and rituals served an integral function in the redefinition of sex in the 20th century. Queer theory calls into question easy proclamations about what counts as natural or normal by drawing attention to the presumed binaries that frequently govern the classification of sex. The maintenance of the colony required the careful management of sex with its obstruction devices, hypersexualized indicator animals, segregation cages, and castrated rats injected with hormones. Moreover, Beach's own writings indicate how his own domestic life became entangled with the sex lives of the rats. An irony animates this Rockefeller-funded sexology: Research funded to elucidate the mechanisms underlying heterosexuality came to question its innateness and universality.

The bisexual, estrogen-sensitive male had been demonstrated. Another major, albeit contrasting, discovery was made in the 1950s, when William Young’s group reported that male guinea pigs and prenatally testosterone-treated female guinea pigs are relatively insensitive to estrogen when tested for lordosis as adults. Reduced estrogen sensitivity was part of the new concept of organization of the neural tissues mediating the sexual behavior of females into tissues similar to those of males. The importance of neural organization by early androgen stimulation was realized immediately and led to the discovery of a variety of sex differences in the brains of adult animals. By contrast, the importance of the metabolism of testosterone into estrogen in the male was recognized only after a delay. While the finding that males are sensitive to estrogen was based on Bernhard Zondek’s discovery in 1934 that testosterone is metabolized into estrogen in males, the finding that males are insensitive to estrogen was based on the hypothesis that testosterone–male sexual behavior is the typical relationship in the male. It is suggested that this difference in theoretical framework explains the discrepancies in some of the reported results.},

AIM: This study aimed to identify neurochemical and neuroanatomical systems involved in sexual excitation and inhibition, their role during normal, and hypoactive sexual expressions.
METHODS: A comprehensive review of the human and animal literature is made, and a theory surrounding the ways that HSDD can be manifested and treated is presented.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Drug effects and neural systems derived largely from rat studies that are involved in the stimulation of sexual desire (excitatory system) vs. the stimulation of sexual reward, sedation, and satiety (inhibitory system).
RESULTS: Brain dopamine systems (incertohypothalamic and mesolimbic) that link the hypothalamus and limbic system appear to form the core of the excitatory system. This system also includes melanocortins, oxytocin, and norepinephrine. Brain opioid, endocannabinoid, and serotonin systems are activated during periods of sexual inhibition, and blunt the ability of excitatory systems to be activated.
CONCLUSIONS: Drugs that stimulate the activation of hypothalamic dopamine or that blunt endocannabinoid or serotonin release and/or postsynaptic binding may be effective in stimulating sexual desire in animals and humans. The characterization of how those drugs work will help generate a rational approach to drug development in the treatment of HSDD.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Some men seek castration outside a clear medical need. This study explored how their sexuality changed after castration.
AIM: To explore changes in preferred gender(s) of sexual attraction, fantasy, and relationships in voluntarily castrated men with or without gonadal hormone therapy.
METHODS: A questionnaire was posted at http://www.eunuch.org that yielded data on men who had been voluntarily castrated physically (n = 198) or chemically (n = 96).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Respondents were asked to report retrospectively on their sexuality, including their sexual activity and which gender(s) they were sexually attracted to, fantasized about, or had sexual relations with 6 months to 1 year before and after castration.
RESULTS: A substantial proportion of men remained sexually active after castration; 37\% had sex at least several times per week. Most respondents did not report a change in preferred gender(s) of attraction (65\%, n = 181), fantasies (62\%, n = 169), or sexual relationships (66\%, n = 163), although approximately 20\% to 30\% of respondents did report such changes and 8\% to 11\% became non-sexual after castration. Respondents who were attracted to and fantasized about "only men" or who had sexual relationship with "only women" before castration were the least likely to report a change subsequent to castration. Respondents who were taking neither supplemental testosterone nor estrogen were more likely to report (i) becoming attracted to no one, (ii) fantasizing about no one, and (iii) becoming sexually inactive.
CONCLUSION: Sexual changes in voluntarily castrated men vary and can be influenced by various factors including the use of supplemental testosterone or estrogen therapy.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Some healthy males voluntarily seek castration without a recognized medical need. There are currently no standards of care for these individuals, which cause many of them to obtain surgery outside of a licensed medical setting. We seek to understand who performs these surgeries.
AIM: This study aims to characterize individuals who perform or assist in genital ablations outside of the healthcare system.
METHODS: A cross-sectional Internet survey posted on eunuch.org received 2,871 responses. We identified individuals who had performed or assisted in human castrations ("cutters"; n = 98) and compared this group with all other survey respondents (n = 2,773), who had not assisted in castrations. Next we compared the cutters with the voluntary eunuchs. Lastly, because many of the cutters have themselves been castrated, we also divided the physically castrated population (n = 278) into cutters (n = 44) and noncutters (n = 234) and compared them.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported questionnaires were used to collect demographic information, gender identity and presentation, selected childhood experiences, and history of aggressive behaviors, self-harming behaviors, and hospitalization.
RESULTS: DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS OF CUTTERS INCLUDED: (i) presenting themselves as very masculine, (ii) having had their longest sexual relationship with a man, (iii) growing up on a farm, (iv) witnessing animal castrations, (v) having a history of sexually inappropriate behavior, (vi) having been threatened with genital mutilation as a child, (vii) having a history of self-harm, (viii) being raised in a devoutly Christian household, (ix) having had an underground castration themselves, and (x) having body piercings and/or tattoos.
CONCLUSIONS: This study may help identify individuals who are at risk of performing illegal castrations. That information may help healthcare providers protect individuals with extreme castration ideations from injuring themselves or others. Jackowich RA, Vale R, Vale K, Wassersug RJ, and Johnson TW.

Previous studies have been unable to identify the full spectrum of driver genes and molecular processes that operate in medulloblastoma subgroups. Here we analyse the somatic landscape across 491 sequenced medulloblastoma samples and the molecular heterogeneity among 1,256 epigenetically analysed cases, and identify subgroup-specific driver alterations that include previously undiscovered actionable targets. Driver mutations were confidently assigned to most patients belonging to Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastoma subgroups, greatly enhancing previous knowledge. New molecular subtypes were differentially enriched for specific driver events, including hotspot in-frame insertions that target KBTBD4 and 'enhancer hijacking' events that activate PRDM6. Thus, the application of integrative genomics to an extensive cohort of clinical samples derived from a single childhood cancer entity revealed a series of cancer genes and biologically relevant subtype diversity that represent attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of patients with medulloblastoma.},

	abstract = {Methamphetamine (MA) is a psychomotor stimulant associated with increases in sex drive in both men and women. Women, however, are far more likely to face social disadvantages as a consequence of MA use, and their increased sexual motivation poses additional health concerns such as unplanned pregnancies. To better understand the mechanisms underlying MA-facilitated sexual motivation in females, we previously established a rodent model where a "binge"-type administration paradigm of MA to sexually receptive female rats significantly increases proceptive behavior in the presence of a sexually active, gonadally-intact male. Our previous work with this model has led us to consider whether the increases in proceptive behavior are truly indicative of increased sexual motivation, or instead a consequence of heightened motor responsivity. Here, we test whether MA-induced increases in proceptive behaviors are specific to a sexually relevant stimulus. Females' sexual, social, exploratory behaviors, and interaction times were scored during the exposure to stimulus males, including castrates, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-treated castrates. MA-treated females demonstrated significant increases in proceptive behaviors toward DHT-treated castrate males but not toward castrate males. While the non-MA-treated females did display proceptive behavior, there was no significant difference between behaviors elicited by DHT-CX males compared to CX males. Our results support the hypothesis that MA facilitates proceptive behavior only in response to specific, androgen mediated sexually-relevant cues.},

	abstract = {A castrato (Italian, plural: castrati) is a type of classical male singing voice equivalent to that of a soprano, mezzo-soprano, or contralto. The voice is produced by castration of the singer before puberty, or it occurs in one who, due to an endocrinological condition, never reaches sexual maturity.
Castration before puberty (or in its early stages) prevents a boy's larynx from being transformed by the normal physiological events of puberty. As a result, the vocal range of prepubescence (shared by both sexes) is largely retained, and the voice develops into adulthood in a unique way. Prepubescent castration for this purpose diminished greatly in the late 18th century and was made illegal in Italy in 1870.
As the castrato's body grew, his lack of testosterone meant that his epiphyses (bone-joints) did not harden in the normal manner. Thus the limbs of the castrati often grew unusually long, as did the bones of their ribs. This, combined with intensive training, gave them unrivalled lung-power and breath capacity. Operating through small, child-sized vocal cords, their voices were also extraordinarily flexible, and quite different from the equivalent adult female voice. Their vocal range was higher than that of the uncastrated adult male. Listening to the only surviving recordings of a castrato (see below), one can hear that the lower part of the voice sounds like a "super-high" tenor, with a more falsetto-like upper register above that.
Castrati were rarely referred to as such: in the 18th century, the euphemism musico (pl musici) was much more generally used, although it usually carried derogatory implications; another synonym was evirato, literally meaning "emasculated". Eunuch is a more general term, since historically many eunuchs were castrated after puberty and thus the castration had no impact on their voices.},

Although the number of studies and extent of available evidence is greatest in stroke and dementia, there is also evidence for the effects of music-based interventions on supporting cognition, motor function, or emotional wellbeing in people with Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis. Music-based interventions can affect divergent functions such as motor performance, speech, or cognition in these patient groups. However, the psychological effects and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of music interventions are likely to share common neural systems for reward, arousal, affect regulation, learning, and activity-driven plasticity. Although further controlled studies are needed to establish the efficacy of music in neurological recovery, music-based interventions are emerging as promising rehabilitation strategies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Music cognition depends on the existence and deployment of processes for detecting, storing and organizing musical materials according to underlying structural features. Common cultural experiences develop these processes to a certain degree, but specifically designed and supported learning environments are required to achieve the levels of expertise required to perform western art music. Certain motivational and social factors are therefore implicated in the maintenance of activities that promote skill-acquisition, such as practice. Expert musical performance is not just a matter of technical motor skill, it also requires the ability to generate expressively different performances of the same piece of music according to the nature of intended structural and emotional communication. This review examines these abilities and describes how some of them have been shown to have lawful relationships to objective musical and extra-musical parameters. Psychological research is thus engaged in a process of demystifying musical expertise, a process that helps to improve upon culturally prevalent, but ultimately non-explanatory, notions of inborn ‘talent’.},

音乐疗法（Music Therapy）和普通音乐干预（general music intrvention）是要区分开的。
音乐跟其他刺激，包括食物、啪啪啪、嗑药等，动员个体去学习、完成目标，以获得愉悦感，是一样的，还是通过不同的神经网络来达成这些效应？
调节情绪是人们最常见的听音乐的理由之一，音乐引起的情绪变化多种多样，可营造强烈的愉悦和兴奋感，诱发出“战憟”或“脊背悚然”的生理表现。
尼玛说到后面是一样的。就是一样的化学物质……

New trends aimed at resolving this question include prospective longitudinal studies of genetically at-risk infants, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies, and studies aimed at evaluating the effects of auditory training (including musical training) on brain organization for language. Better understanding of the origins of developmental LLI will advance our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying individual differences in language development and lead to more effective educational and intervention strategies.

These modulations might adaptively tune hierarchically organized sound feature maps of the auditory cortex (e.g. tonotopy), thus filtering relevant sounds during rapidly changing environmental and task demands. This could support auditory sensory memory, pre-attentive detection of sound novelty, enhanced perception during selective attention, influence of visual processing on auditory perception and longer-term plastic changes associated with perceptual learning.},

The question of how musical sounds can have such profound emotional and rewarding effects has been a topic of interest throughout generations. At a fundamental level, listening to music involves tracking a series of sound events over time. Because humans are experts in pattern recognition, temporal predictions are constantly generated, creating a sense of anticipation. We summarize how complex cognitive abilities and cortical processes integrate with fundamental subcortical reward and motivation systems in the brain to give rise to musical pleasure. This work builds on previous theoretical models that emphasize the role of prediction in music appreciation by integrating these ideas with recent neuroscientific evidence.},

	abstract = {The auditory cortex has a crucial role in higher cognitive functions, including the perception of speech, music and auditory space. Cortical plasticity, as in other sensory systems, is used in the fine tuning of the auditory system for these higher functions. Auditory cortical plasticity can also be demonstrated after lesions of the cochlea and it appears to participate in generating tinnitus. Early musical training leads to an expansion in the representation of complex harmonic sounds in the auditory cortex. Similarly, the early phonetic environment has a strong influence on speech development and, presumably, on the cortical organization of speech. In auditory spatial perception, the spectral cues generated by the head and outer ears vary between individuals and have to be calibrated by learning, which most probably takes place at the cortical level. The neural mechanisms of plasticity are likely to be the same across all cortical regions. It should be useful, therefore, to relate some of the findings and hypotheses about auditory cortical plasticity to previous studies of other sensory systems.},

We, therefore, predicted that this network would be reorganized via musical training-induced neuroplasticity. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed resting-state functional connectivity of the thalamocortical network in musicians (n=35) and nonmusicians (n=35). The seed-to-voxel functional connectivity analysis of the left thalamus seed showed enhanced connectivity voxels in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in musicians compared with nonmusicians. Region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI functional connectivity analysis showed that the auditory areas were also more strongly connected with the left thalamus in musicians. Discriminant analysis using the ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity data of the precuneus/PCC and auditory areas as predictors yielded an 87\% correct discrimination of musicians from nonmusicians. Therefore, we can conclude that, as a consequence of long-term musical training, musicians have a characteristically organized thalamocortical network. The precuneus and PCC are principal nodes of the default mode network and play a pivotal role in the manipulation of mental imagery. We propose that the reorganized thalamocortical network in musicians contributes not only to higher sensitivity to sound but also to the integration of mental imagery with sound, which are both presumed to be important for better music performance.},

Cell的图片指南








图示
Each figure should be able to fit on a single 8.5 x 11 inch page.不要把图中的模块当做单个文件发送。我们的三个标准尺寸：1 column, 85 mm; 1.5 column, 114 mm; and 2 column, 174 mm (the full width of the page). Although your figure size may be reduced in the print journal, please keep these widths in mind.预览或其他三栏版式中，这些尺寸也能应用，不过这样单栏宽度就变成55 mm。
不同模块要以大写字母标注，任何文字的字体都要用Helvetica或Arial。线条或笔画不应小于0.5点，灰度填色should be kept at least 20\% different from other fills and不应浅于10度或深于80度。文件要符合以下标准：

Figures should be submitted as separate files.
初始提交要用tiff或pdf格式，也接受jpeg或eps文件。PDF文件大小不应超过3 MB。
终印版要用高清tiff或pdf文件。每个图片文件大小不应超过20 MB。
彩高分辨率要300 dpi。
黑白图，分辨率要500 dpi。
线描图，分辨率要达到1,000 dpi。
原始图象中的任何光栅图片都要确保达到最小分辨率。
有颜色的时候要用RGB编码。
Always include/embed fonts且只用Helvetica或Arial字体。
Limit vertical space between parts of an illustration to only what is necessary for visual clarity.
线宽应在0.35{\textasciitilde}1.5点之间。
应用图层的话，保存的时候要合并成一层。(Flatten Artwork).
任何显微图像都要加上比例尺，比倍率好。

*NOTE: Cell 也接受Ai文件，是Leading Edge图像的话.
*NOTE: 图像的任何操作要确保符合我们的《数据加工指南》
文件格式
TIFF
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)和 PDF是最好的终版格式，实际上大多数图形处理软件都支持保存为tiff格式。TIFF格式推荐用于任何位图、灰度图和彩图。TIFF支持各种压缩方案，ensuring that file sizes are kept to a minimum to aid easy file transfer.任何时候都最好用LZW压缩法。
PDF
PDF and TIFF are the preferred file types for final production files.
EPS
基本上所有图形处理文件都能保存EPS格式。
MS Office (Word, Excel, PPT Figures)
用了这种微软系就请转换成PDF格式。应用时确保最小分辨率。插入以后不要改变尺寸。
AI (Illustrator)
AI文件只能用于Cell的Leading Edge栏目。保存时字体要选嵌入式（embed）。图片也要选嵌入式（嵌入外部图片，在Ai界面选择link菜单）。如果没有嵌好，印刷时可能会丢失。
评审阶段的文件大小
初始提交或评审、修改阶段，图片尽量小（1-2 MB）。如果最终接受付梓，我们会根据需要跟你收高清图。
普通图片问题集
Editorial Manager无法接收
我们的Editorial Manager接收TIFF, PDF, JPEG, 和EPS文件，其他文件要转换成这此格式之一。很多图形软件都支持PDF格式，例如Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Canvas, ChemDraw, CorelDraw, SigmaPlot, Origin Lab等。
文件太大
我们单个文件的上限是20 MB。压缩的办法有合并图层，或减小分辨率但不要低于我们的下限。如果是做TIFF文件请使用LZW压缩法。如果是PDF文件，选择“文件{\textgreater}另存为{\textgreater}压缩PDF”(看了，没有）。如果都不能小于20mb，请呼叫杂志小编。
图示摘要
参见专门指南：Cell Press Graphical Abstracts Guidelines 。
图示摘要是一图读懂文章关键内容的一张小方图。目的是增加浏览量，促进学科间交流，让读者一眼看出是否和自己的领域相关。（所以务必简洁明了。）
技术指南：

尺寸：5.5寸见方，分辨率300 dpi.
字体：Arial, 12–16 点。再小就不能辨认了。
格式：TIFF, PDF, JPEG
内容：只能有1个图，不要分成小模块。 

Homepage Slider Images
Please refer to the Cell Press Slider Image Guidelines page for examples of and comprehensive instructions for homepage slider images.
就是网页顶部惹眼的大滑动图。 Please check with your journal’s Journal Associate if you are uncertain whether a slider image should be submitted with your article.
You may create a new image specifically for the slider, or you may crop a preexisting image associated with your paper.
Keep in mind that the upper-left quadrant of images displayed in the slider will be partially obscured by the title of the article and, in some cases, author lists and blurbs. Therefore, do not use an image with important elements placed in the top-left quadrant. The right side of the canvas is the best area to place important elements. For your assistance, we have provided a slider image template file that approximates the size of the text box. Feel free to use this file to guide you as you prepare you image. But be sure to hide Layer 2 (which includes the text box and arrows) when you export your final version into a JPEG.

Dimension: 592 x 200 pixels (1.973 x 0.667 in / 5.01 x 1.69 cm)
Color mode: RGB, 8 bit (other color modes will not display properly online)
File type: JPEG (other file types will not display properly online)
Image quality: Medium to High / 6–12 (highest setting that will keep the file size under 100 KB)
File size: {\textless}100 KB

 
数据处理政策
尽量避免获取数据之后再加工。有时候不可避免，但也要保证能反映原始情况。处理图像时，要调整就必须全局调整，比如明度、对比度、色彩平衡等。某些罕见情况下做不到这样（比如在显微图像中调整单色通道），那所做的操作必需在图片说明中加以说明，并在文章的Experimental Procedures部分说明。Groupings and consolidation of data (e.g., cropping of images or removal of lanes from gels and blots) must be made apparent and should be explicitly indicated in the appropriate figure legends. Data comparisons should only be made from comparative experiments, and individual data should not be utilized across multiple figures. In cases in which data are used multiple times (e.g., multiple experiments were performed simultaneously with a single control experiment), this must be clearly stated within each figure legend. In the event that it is deemed necessary for proper evaluation of the manuscript, authors will be required to make the original unprocessed data available to the editors of the journal. All accepted manuscripts will be taken through a data presentation image screening process before publication.

图的标题需在说明文字的前面，而不是在图中。
图的标号（如Fig.1）要标在有该图的那一页
Keys to symbols, if needed, should be kept as simple as possible and be positioned so they do not needlessly enlarge the figure. Details can be put into the captions.



Use solid symbols for plotting data if possible (unless data overlap or there are multiple symbols). Size symbols so that they will be distinguishable when the figure is reduced (6 pt minimum). Line widths should be legible upon reduction (minimum of 0.5 pt at the final reduced size).


Panels should be set close to each other, and common axis labels should not be repeated.


Scales or axes should not extend beyond the range of the data plotted.


Use scale bars in place of, or in addition to, magnifications. Do not use minor tick marks in scales or grid lines. Avoid using y-axis labels on the right that repeat those on the left.


Color-mix and contrast considerations


Avoid using red and green together. Color blind individuals will not be able read the figure.


Please do not use colors that are close in hue to identify different parts of a figure.


Avoid using grayscale.


Use white type and scale bars over darker areas of images.


Units should be metric and follow SI convention.


Typefaces and labels


Please observe the following guidelines for labels on graphs and figures:


Use a sans-serif font whenever possible (we prefer Helvetica).


Simple solid or open symbols reduce well.


Label graphs on the ordinate and abscissa with the parameter or variable being measured, the units of measure in parentheses, and the scale. Scales with large or small numbers should be presented as powers of 10.


Avoid the use of light lines and screen shading. Instead, use black-and-white, hatched, and cross-hatched designs for emphasis.


Capitalize the first letter in a label only, not every word (and proper nouns, of course).


Units should be included in parentheses. Use SI notation. If there is room, write out variables – e.g., Pressure (MPa), Temperature (K).


Variables are always set in italics or as plain Greek letters (e.g., P, T, m). The rest of the text in the figure should be plain or bold text.


Type on top of color in a color figure should be in bold face. Avoid using color type.


When figures are assembled from multiple gels or micrographs, a line or space should indicate the border between two original images.


Use leading zeros on all decimals – e.g., 0.3, 0.55 – and only report significant digits.


Use capital letters for part labels in multipart figures – A, B, C, etc. These should be 9 pt and bold in the final figure. When possible, place part labels at the upper left-hand corner of each figure part; if a part is an image, set labels inside the perimeter so as not to waste space.


Avoid subpart labels within a figure part; instead, maintain the established sequence of part labels [e.g., use A, B, C, D, E instead of A, B, C(a), C(b), C©]. If use of subpart labels is unavoidable, use lowercase letters (a, b, c). Use numbers (1, 2, 3) only to represent a time sequence of images.


When reproducing images that include labels with illegible computer-generated type (e.g., units for scale bars), omit such labels and present the information in the legend instead.


Sequences may be reduced considerably, so the typeface in the original should be clear. There should be about 130 characters and spaces per line for a sequence occupying the full width of the printed page and about 84 characters and spaces per line for a sequence occupying two columns.


Modification of figures Science does not allow certain electronic enhancements or manipulations of micrographs, gels, or other digital images. Figures assembled from multiple photographs or images, or non-concurrent portions of the same image, must indicate the separate parts with lines between them. Linear adjustment of contrast, brightness, or color must be applied to an entire image or plate equally. Nonlinear adjustments must be specified in the figure legend. Selective enhancement or alteration of one part of an image is not acceptable. In addition, Science may ask authors of papers returned for revision to provide additional documentation of their primary data.

This has created a unique situation in which clinical studies have outpaced efforts at the bench. As such, reliable predictive biomarkers have not yet been identified that define who will benefit from this method of treatment, and there is only a partial understanding of the mechanisms of sensitivity or resistance to immunotherapy. On pages 1428 and 1423 of this issue, Hui et al. (2) and Kamphorst et al. (3), respectively, elucidate important mechanisms of checkpoint blockade by demonstrating that PD-1 exerts its primary effect of dampening T cell activation by regulating a T cell receptor costimulatory molecule called cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28).

	abstract = {Estimates of additive interaction from case-control data are often obtained by logistic regression; such models can also be used to adjust for covariates. This approach to estimating additive interaction has come under some criticism because of possible misspecification of the logistic model: If the underlying model is linear, the logistic model will be misspecified. The authors propose an inverse probability of treatment weighting approach to causal effects and additive interaction in case-control studies. Under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding, the approach amounts to fitting a marginal structural linear odds model. The approach allows for the estimation of measures of additive interaction between dichotomous exposures, such as the relative excess risk due to interaction, using case-control data without having to rely on modeling assumptions for the outcome conditional on the exposures and covariates. Rather than using conditional models for the outcome, models are instead specified for the exposures conditional on the covariates. The approach is illustrated by assessing additive interaction between genetic and environmental factors using data from a case-control study.},

Potential participants are randomly selected, stratified by age and sex, and invited to participate in cognitive assessments; individuals without medical contraindications are invited to participate in brain imaging studies. Participants who were judged clinically as having no cognitive impairment and underwent multimodality imaging between Oct 11, 2006, and Oct 5, 2016, were included in the current study. Participants were classified as having normal (A−) or abnormal (A+) amyloid using amyloid PET, normal (T−) or abnormal (T+) tau using tau PET, and normal (N−) or abnormal (N+) neurodegeneration or neuronal injury using cortical thickness assessed by MRI. We used the cutoff points of standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) 1·42 (centiloid 19) for amyloid PET, 1·23 SUVR for tau PET, and 2·67 mm for MRI cortical thickness. Age-specific and sex-specific prevalences of the eight groups were determined using multinomial models combining data from 435 individuals with amyloid PET, tau PET, and MRI assessments, and 1113 individuals who underwent amyloid PET and MRI, but not tau PET imaging.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The numbers of participants in each profile group were 165 A−T−N−, 35 A−T+N−, 63 A−T−N+, 19 A−T+N+, 44 A+T−N−, 25 A+T+N−, 35 A+T−N+, and 49 A+T+N+. Age differed by ATN group (p{\textless}0·0001), ranging from a median 58 years (IQR 55–64) in A–T–N– and 57 years (54–64) in A–T+N– to a median 80 years (75–84) in A+T–N+ and 79 years (73–87) in A+T+N+. The number of \textit{APOE} ε4 carriers differed by ATN group (p=0·04), with carriers roughly twice as frequent in each A+ group versus the corresponding A– group. White matter hyperintensity volume (p{\textless}0·0001) and cognitive performance (p{\textless}0·0001) also differed by ATN group.

From age 50 years, A−T−N− prevalence declined and A+T+N+ and A−T+N+ prevalence increased. In both men and women, A−T−N− was the most prevalent until age late 70s.

	abstract = {研究背景阿尔茨海默病(Alzheimer's disease, AD)是一种与衰老密切相关的神经系统退行性病变,以进行性认知能力下降和社会功能障碍为临床特点。AD的发病机制尚未完全阐明,目前应用的临床药物仅为对症治疗,无法防止病情进展。β淀粉样蛋白(Amyloid beta, Aβ)是AD重要的致病物质。Ap产生和清除平衡障碍导致脑内Ap过度沉积,被认为是散发型AD(约占全部AD的99\%)主要的发病原因。清除脑内Aβ是AD防治的一个重要策略。Ap清除包括从中枢途径清除(中枢清除)和从外周途径清除(外周清除)。目前开展的一系列以抗Ap抗体免疫治疗为代表的清除Ap的临床研究均未成功。其主要原因被认为是干预时间太晚。同时,在临床试验中出现的脑炎、血管损害等副作用也是影响免疫治疗安全性的重要因素。免疫治疗的这些副作用均与抗体进入脑内(中枢清除)有关。因此,避免药物进入脑内,通过外周途径清除脑内Aβ可能是一条更为安全的途径。然而,Aβ的外周清除目前仍存在诸多困惑。其一,虽然多项研究提示外周脏器、组织和分子具有清除Ap的作用,但生理条件下整个外周系统清除脑内Ap的能力和有效性尚不清楚。其二,之前研究者通过在外周途径给予药物以验证Aβ外周清除是否能降低脑内Ap水平的研究结论也存在争议。因此,明确机体Ap外周清除的能力和机制,阐明Aβ外周清除能力在AD发生中的作用,对于深入理解AD发生机制,建立安全有效的AD防治措施,具有重要的科学意义和临床应用前景。材料与方法1.机体外周脏器组织的Aβ清除能力的检测纳入30例房室折返性心动过速患者,在射频消融术中,采集上腔静脉、下腔静脉(肝静脉开口近端)、股动脉和股静脉血液,分离血清。同时,采用APP/PS1转基因AD小鼠10只,通过手术方法采集颈静脉、腹主动脉和后腔静脉血液,分离血清。采用ELISA方法,检测成人和APP/PS1转基因AD小鼠循环系统不同部位血液Aβ水平,比较静脉血与动脉血Aβ水平的比值。2.外周脏器组织Aβ代谢能力的检测采用野生型C57BL/6J小鼠14只,进行放射性同位素实验,通过尾静脉注射125I标记的Aβ,2小时后采集各主要外周脏器和组织,利用伽马射线计数器测量各个主要外周脏器和组织的放射性计数,观察Aβ在外周主要脏器和组织的生物分布。3.并联共生动物模型的建立建立并联共生(Parabiosis)动物模型,通过手术方法将APP/PS1小鼠同野生型C57BL/6J小鼠进行并联,借此给APP/PS1小鼠增加一套完整的外周系统。预防实验中,采用3月龄雌性APP/PS1小鼠(此时小鼠脑内尚无大量Ap沉积及病理改变形成)与同龄同性别野生型小鼠并联,9月龄时进行组织取材及检测。治疗实验中,采用9月龄雌性APP/PS1小鼠(此时小鼠脑内已有大量Ap沉积及病理改变形成)与同龄同性别野生型小鼠并联,12月龄时进行组织取材及检测。4.AD脑内Aβ水平的检测采用刚果红染色、免疫组化染色、ELISA检测,观察并联共生对APP/PS1小鼠脑内老年斑、Ap沉积以及脑组织提取液内Ap水平的影响。采用刚果红染色、免疫荧光双重标记以及普鲁士蓝染色,观察并联共生对APP/PS1小鼠脑血管淀粉样变(Cerebral amyloid angiopathy, CAA)和脑微出血的影响。采用免疫蛋白印迹,观察并联共生对APP/PS1小鼠脑内淀粉样前体蛋白(Amyloid precursor protein, APP)及其代谢产物、与Aβ合成和分解有关的酶以及转运受体的影响。5.AD脑内相关病理的检测采用免疫组化染色、免疫荧光多重标记、ELISA检测以及免疫蛋白印记,观察并联共生对APP/PS1小鼠脑内小胶质细胞和星形胶质细胞活化、细胞因子水平、Tau蛋白过度磷酸化的影响。采用免疫荧光双重标记和免疫蛋白印记,观察并联共生对APP/PS1小鼠脑内神经元缺失、凋亡和突触变性坏死的影响。结果1.机体存在天然的Aβ外周清除能力以动脉血(成人为股动脉血,APP/PS1小鼠为腹主动脉血)Aβ水平作为参照,计算每个个体不同部位静脉血Ap水平与动脉血Ap水平的比值。通过比较上述比值显示,成人上腔静脉血Aβ40和总Aβ (Aβ40+Aβ42)水平显著高于股静脉血,股静脉血Aβ40和总Aβ水平显著高于下腔静脉血。同时,APP/PS1小鼠颈静脉血Aβ40和总Ap水平显著高于后腔静脉血。另外,3月龄野生型小鼠尾静脉注射1251标记的Aβ后2小时,皮肤、胃肠道和肝脏放射性计数占总放射性计数的比值明显高于心脏、脾脏、肺脏和脑,肝脏、肾脏、胃肠道和皮肤单位重量脏器放射性计数显著高于其他脏器。2.并联共生显著预防Aβ在AD脑内沉积预防实验中,采用刚果红染色,9月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠脑内刚果红染色阳性面积占总观察面积百分比(Area fraction\%)较对照组APP/PS1小鼠明显减少,其中,新皮层减少约77.43\%(0.3164±0.0259 vs 1.4016±0.0497, P{\textless}0.01),海马减少约71.22\%(0.02636±0.0236 vs 0.9159±0.0631, P{\textless}0.01)。同时,9月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠单位面积脑片上刚果红染色阳性颗粒的数量(Plaque No./mm2)较对照组APP/PS1小鼠明显减少,其中,新皮层减少约80.10\%(13.7758±1.5062 vs 69.2223±3.4455,P{\textless}0.01),海马减少约76.58\%(10.8991±1.3055 vs 46.5435±3.1947,P{\textless}0.01)。采用6E10抗体免疫组化染色,9月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠脑内6E10抗体免疫组化染色阳性面积占总观察面积百分比(Area fraction\%)较对照组APP/PS1小鼠明显减少,其中,新皮层减少约85.97\%(5.8096±0.9244 vs 41.4155±2.0209, P{\textless}0.01),海马减少约82.62\%(3.3584±0.6359 vs19.3194±1.4791,P{\textless}0.01)。同时,9月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠单位面积脑片上6E10抗体免疫组化染色阳性颗粒的数量(Plaque No./mm2)较对照组APP/PS1小鼠明显减少,其中,新皮层减少约80.49\%(20.3321±2.4963 vs 104.2200±4.4021,P{\textless}0.01),海马减少约83.56\%(9.0656±1.0702 vs 55.1584±2.1844,P{\textless}0.01)。此外,脑组织提取液内Ap测定显示,9月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠脑内Aβ40在TBS、2\%SDS、70\%甲酸三种提取液中的水平均明显低于对照组APP/PS1小鼠(TBS:0.1148±0.0100 vs 0.0436±0.0056, P{\textless}0.01;

2\%SDS: 0.8295±0.1211 vs 0.3249±0.0521, P{\textless}0.01; 70\%甲酸：3.5536±0.2662 vs 1.0570±0.1129,P{\textless}0.01)。进一步计算脑内总Aβ (Aβ40+Aβ42)可见,9月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠脑内总Aβ无论是各个提取液内的水平(TBS:0.6367±0.0577 vs 0.2687±0.0338, P{\textless}0.01; 2\%SDS: 1.5712±0.0901 vs 0.4582±0.0639, P{\textless}0.01; 70\%甲酸：6.6317±0.3913 vs 2.1083±0.2173,P{\textless}0.01),还是各种提取液内水平之和(8.8396±0.4034 vs 2.8352±0.2520,P{\textless}0.01),均明显低于对照组APP/PS1小鼠。另外,较对照组APP/PS1小鼠而言,9月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠CAA面积占比和平均数量以及脑内微出血数量均明显减少。同时,9月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠脑内APP及其代谢产物C末端片段(C terminal fragment, CTF)-α、CTF-β,Aβ生成限速酶BACE1及Aβ降解酶IDE、NEP、Aβ转运受体LRP-1和RAGE的表达无变化。3.并联共生显著抑制AD脑内Aβ沉积的增长治疗实验中,采用刚果红染色,12月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠新皮层刚果红染色阳性面积占总观察面积百分比(Area fraction\%)较对照组APP/PS1小鼠明显减少约17.10\%(1.4134±0.0888 vs 1.7049±0.0396,P{\textless}0.05),同时,新皮层单位面积脑片上刚果红染色阳性颗粒的数量(Plaque No./mm)较对照组APP/PS1小鼠明显减少约16.94\%(76.0826±3.7654 vs 87.9899±4.6522, P{\textless}0.05).治疗实验中,12月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠新皮层6E10抗体免疫组化染色阳性面积占总观察面积百分比(Area fraction\%)较对照组APP/PS1小鼠明显减少约36.02\%(48.6341±2.2949 vs 76.0197±3.7302, P{\textless}0.01),海马减少约26.72\%(23.2100±1.6363 vs 36.6794±2.4699,P{\textless}0.01)。同时,新皮层单位面积脑片上6E10抗体免疫组化阳性染色颗粒的数量(Plaque No./mm2)较对照组APP/PS1小鼠明显减少约28.60\%(115.1200±4.1091 vs 161.2300±5.9683,P{\textless}0.01)。4.并联共生显著减轻AD相关病理特征较对照组APP/PS1小鼠而言,9月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠脑内小胶质细胞标志物CD45抗体、星形胶质细胞标志物GFAP抗体免疫组化染色阳性区域面积占观察区域总面积占比(Area fraction\%)显著减少,单位面积脑片上免疫组化染色阳性的细胞数量(Cell No./mm2)显著减少。同时,9月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠脑匀浆内细胞因子TNF-α、IL-1β和IL-6水平较对照组APP/PS1小鼠显著降低。另外,9月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠脑内Tau蛋白磷酸化位点标志物pS396抗体免疫组化染色阳性区域面积占观察区域总面积占比(Area fraction\%)显著减少,单位面积脑片上pS396抗体免疫组化染色阳性的细胞数量(Cell No./mm2)显著减少。同时,与对照组APP/PS1小鼠比较,9月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠脑匀浆内pS396、pS199蛋白免疫印迹条带相对密度明显减少。同时,9月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠海马CA1区和CA3区神经元标志物NeuN抗体及CA1区神经元标志物MAP-2抗体免疫荧光标记阳性区域面积占观察区域总面积占比(Area fraction\%)显著增多,海马CA3区细胞凋亡标志物Caspase-3抗体免疫荧光阳性标记区域面积占观察区域总面积占比(Area fraction\%)显著减少。9月龄并联APP/PS1小鼠脑匀浆内突触后膜标志物PSD-93和PSD-95以及突触前膜标志物Synapsin-1和Synaptophysin表达明显增高。结论1.生理条件下,外周脏器组织具有清除脑内Aβ的能力,肝脏、肾脏、肠道和皮肤是Aβ外周清除的重要部位。2.增强Aβ外周清除能力可以减少AD脑内老年斑、Aβ沉积及脑组织提取液内Aβ水平,减少CAA及其导致的脑微出血等Aβ相关病理。3.增强Aβ外周清除能力可以减轻AD脑内小胶质细胞和星形胶质细胞活化、降低细胞因子水平、减轻Tau蛋白过度磷酸化。同时,Aβ外周清除能力减轻AD脑内神经元缺失、凋亡,减少突触变性坏死。4.Aβ外周清除是AD防治的有效途径,值得进一步探索。5.由于AD小鼠脑内约40\%的Ap流向外周而被清除,提示外周脏器组织Ap清除能力下降可能参与AD的发生和发展,值得探索。},

	abstract = {The complement cascade not only is an innate immune response that enables removal of pathogens but also plays an important role in microglia-mediated synaptic refinement during brain development. Complement C3 is elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), colocalizing with neuritic plaques, and appears to contribute to clearance of Aβ by microglia in the brain. Previously, we reported that C3-deficient C57BL/6 mice were protected against age-related and region-specific loss of hippocampal synapses and cognitive decline during normal aging. Furthermore, blocking complement and downstream iC3b/CR3 signaling rescued synapses from Aβ-induced loss in young AD mice before amyloid plaques had accumulated. We assessed the effects of C3 deficiency in aged, plaque-rich APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice (APP/PS1;C3 KO). We examined the effects of C3 deficiency on cognition, Aβ plaque deposition, and plaque-related neuropathology at later AD stages in these mice. We found that 16-month-old APP/PS1;C3 KO mice performed better on a learning and memory task than did APP/PS1 mice, despite having more cerebral Aβ plaques. Aged APP/PS1;C3 KO mice also had fewer microglia and astrocytes localized within the center of hippocampal Aβ plaques compared to APP/PS1 mice. Several proinflammatory cytokines in the brain were reduced in APP/PS1;C3 KO mice, consistent with an altered microglial phenotype. C3 deficiency also protected APP/PS1 mice against age-dependent loss of synapses and neurons. Our study suggests that complement C3 or downstream complement activation fragments may play an important role in Aβ plaque pathology, glial responses to plaques, and neuronal dysfunction in the brains of APP/PS1 mice.},

Cell-to-cell transfer of misfolded proteins has been proposed for the intra-cerebral propagation of these diseases. When released, misfolded proteins diffuse in the 3D extracellular space before binding to the plasma membrane of neighboring cells, where they diffuse on a 2D plane. This reduction in diffusion dimension and the cell surface molecular crowding promote deleterious interactions with native membrane proteins, favoring clustering and further aggregation of misfolded protein assemblies. These processes open up new avenues for therapeutics development targeting the initial interactions of deleterious proteins with the plasma membrane or the subsequent pathological signaling.},

	abstract = {Antibodies targeting Aβ42 are under intense scrutiny because of their therapeutic potential for Alzheimer’s disease. To enable systematic searches, we present an “antibody scanning” strategy for the generation of a panel of antibodies against Aβ42. Each antibody in the panel is rationally designed to target a specific linear epitope, with the selected epitopes scanning the Aβ42 sequence. By screening in vitro the panel to identify the specific microscopic steps in the Aβ42 aggregation process influenced by each antibody, we identify two antibodies that target specifically the primary and the secondary nucleation steps, which are key for the production of Aβ42 oligomers. These two antibodies act, respectively, to delay the onset of aggregation and to block the proliferation of aggregates, and correspondingly reduce the toxicity in a Caenorhabditis elegans model overexpressing Aβ42. These results illustrate how the antibody scanning method described here can be used to readily obtain very small antibody libraries with extensive coverage of the sequences of target proteins.
A rational approach enables the almost complete suppression of nucleation events in Aβ42 aggregation using designed antibodies.

	abstract = {A more pathological amyloid-β oligomer
Amyloid-β (Aβ) is implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and various types of Aβ oligomers emerge at different stages of AD. Aβ promotes the modification and aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau, which is associated with neuronal toxicity and impaired cognition in various neurodegenerative disorders. Using several transgenic mouse models of AD and cultured cortical neurons, Amar et al. found that the 56-kDa oligomer Aβ*56, but not Aβ dimers or trimers, stimulated an influx in intracellular Ca2+ that triggered phosphorylation of tau at a site that promoted its aggregation. The findings link a specific amyloid form to tau pathology and suggest that dissecting the molecular and stage-specific roles of Aβ oligomers may lead to improved therapies.
Oligomeric forms of amyloid-forming proteins are believed to be the principal initiating bioactive species in many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers are implicated in AD-associated phosphorylation and aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. To investigate the specific molecular pathways activated by different assemblies, we isolated various forms of Aβ from Tg2576 mice, which are a model for AD. We found that Aβ*56, a 56-kDa oligomer that is detected before patients develop overt signs of AD, induced specific changes in neuronal signaling. In primary cortical neurons, Aβ*56 interacted with N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), increased NMDAR-dependent Ca2+ influx, and consequently increased intracellular calcium concentrations and the activation of Ca2+-dependent calmodulin kinase IIα (CaMKIIα). In cultured neurons and in the brains of Tg2576 mice, activated CaMKIIα was associated with increased site-specific phosphorylation and missorting of tau, both of which are associated with AD pathology. In contrast, exposure of cultured primary cortical neurons to other oligomeric Aβ forms (dimers and trimers) did not trigger these effects. Our results indicate that distinct Aβ assemblies activate neuronal signaling pathways in a selective manner and that dissecting the molecular events caused by each oligomer may inform more effective therapeutic strategies.
The 56-kDa amyloid-β oligomer triggers pathological tau aggregation through increased Ca2+ influx.

	abstract = {Clearance of amyloid-beta (Aβ) from the brain is an important therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Current studies mainly focus on the central approach of Aβ clearance by introducing therapeutic agents into the brain. In a previous study, we found that peripheral tissues and organs play important roles in clearing brain-derived Aβ, suggesting that the peripheral approach of removing Aβ from the blood may also be effective for AD therapy. Here, we investigated whether peritoneal dialysis, a clinically available therapeutic method for chronic kidney disease (CKD), reduces brain Aβ burden and attenuates AD-type pathologies and cognitive impairments. Thirty patients with newly diagnosed CKD were enrolled. The plasma Aβ concentrations of the patients were measured before and after peritoneal dialysis. APP/PS1 mice were subjected to peritoneal dialysis once a day for 1 month from 6 months of age (prevention study) or 9 months of age (treatment study). The Aβ in the interstitial fluid (ISF) was collected using microdialysis. Behavioural performance, long-term potentiation (LTP), Aβ burden and other AD-type pathologies were measured after 1 month of peritoneal dialysis. Peritoneal dialysis significantly reduced plasma Aβ levels in both CKD patients and APP/PS1 mice. Aβ levels in the brain ISF of APP/PS1 mice immediately decreased after reduction of Aβ in the blood during peritoneal dialysis. In both prevention and treatment studies, peritoneal dialysis substantially reduced Aβ deposition, attenuated other AD-type pathologies, including Tau hyperphosphorylation, glial activation, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and synaptic dysfunction, and rescued the behavioural deficits of APPswe/PS1 mice. Importantly, the Aβ phagocytosis function of microglia was enhanced in APP/PS1 mice after peritoneal dialysis. Our study suggests that peritoneal dialysis is a promising therapeutic method for AD, and Aβ clearance using a peripheral approach could be a desirable therapeutic strategy for AD.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a detrimental neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatments. Due to cellular heterogeneity, defining the roles of immune cell subsets in AD onset and progression has been challenging. Using transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all immune populations in wild-type and AD-transgenic (Tg-AD) mouse brains. We describe a novel microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases (DAM) and identify markers, spatial localization, and pathways associated with these cells. Immunohistochemical staining of mice and human brain slices shows DAM with intracellular/phagocytic Aβ particles. Single-cell analysis of DAM in Tg-AD and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2)−/− Tg-AD reveals that the DAM program is activated in a two-step process. Activation is initiated in a Trem2-independent manner that involves downregulation of microglia checkpoints, followed by activation of a Trem2-dependent program. This unique microglia-type has the potential to restrict neurodegeneration, which may have important implications for future treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.},

Linkage disequilibrium score regression of 220 cell types implicated the regulation of myeloid gene expression in AD risk. The minor allele of rs1057233 (G), within the previously reported CELF1 AD risk locus, showed association with delayed AD onset and lower expression of SPI1 in monocytes and macrophages. SPI1 encodes PU.1, a transcription factor critical for myeloid cell development and function. AD heritability was enriched within the PU.1 cistrome, implicating a myeloid PU.1 target gene network in AD. Finally, experimentally altered PU.1 levels affected the expression of mouse orthologs of many AD risk genes and the phagocytic activity of mouse microglial cells.

Using gene-environment independence enhances the power for testing multiplicative interaction in case-control studies. However, under departure from this assumption, substantial bias in the estimates and inflated Type I error in the corresponding tests can occur. This paper extends the empirical Bayes (EB) approach previously developed for multiplicative interaction that trades off between bias and efficiency in a data-adaptive way, to the additive scale. An EB estimator of Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction is derived and the corresponding Wald test is proposed with general regression setting under a retrospective likelihood framework. We study the impact of gene-environment association on the resultant test with case-control data. Our simulation studies suggest that the EB approach uses the gene-environment independence assumption in a data-adaptive way and provides power gain compared to the standard logistic regression analysis and better control of Type I error when compared to the analysis assuming gene-environment independence. We illustrate the methods with data from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium.},

	abstract = {Authors often do not give sufficient information to draw conclusions about the size and statistical significance of interaction on the additive and multiplicative scales. To improve this, we provide four steps, template tables and examples. We distinguish two cases: when the causal effect of intervening on one exposure, across strata of another factor, is of interest ('effect modification'); and when the causal effect of intervening on two exposures is of interest ('interaction'). Assume we study whether X modifies the effect of A on D, where A, X and D are dichotomous. We propose presenting: (i) relative risks (RRs), odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) for each (A, X) stratum with a single reference category taken as the stratum with the lowest risk of D; (ii) RRs, ORs or RDs for A within strata of X; (iii) interaction measures on additive and multiplicative scales; (iv) the A-D confounders adjusted for. Assume we study the interaction between A and B on D, where A, B and D are dichotomous. Steps (i) and (iii) are similar to presenting effect modification. (ii) Present RRs, ORs or RDs for A within strata of B and for B within strata of A. (iv) List the A-D and B-D confounders adjusted for. These four pieces of information will provide a reader the information needed to assess effect modification or interaction.

	abstract = {[研究背景]
伴随着经济的发展、生活方式和膳食结构的改变,全世界的超重肥胖正在以令人担忧的速度增加。2010年,全球5岁以下超重肥胖儿童超过4200万,其中3500万在发展中国家,而儿童肥胖易发展成青少年肥胖,甚至成年肥胖。据世界卫生组织估计,到2015年,全球约有23亿成人超重者,肥胖者超过7亿。在我们国家超重肥胖也正以令人担忧的速度增加。近些年的调查结果显示,我国超重率约为24.15\%-41.04\%,肥胖率约为4.6\%-23.75\%。虽然各个地方调查的超重肥胖率存在差别,但都比较高,且呈上升态势,超重肥胖问题已不容忽视。
超重肥胖与多种疾病密切相关。肥胖是多种严重慢性疾病的危险因素,如Ⅱ型糖尿病、心血管疾病、异常脂蛋白血症、高血压、睡眠呼吸暂停以及某些癌症；且还阻碍少儿心理行为发育和社会交际,压抑其潜能的发展；同时,超重肥胖也带来巨大的社会和经济负担。超重肥胖已成为目前全球公共卫生的严重问题之一。探索其发病机制,不仅可使肥胖者得到及时有效的治疗,也有利于有效干预措施的提出,预防肥胖的发生,从而遏制肥胖的流行。因为肥胖是Ⅱ型糖尿病、心血管疾病等多种疾病的危险因素,所以遏制肥胖的流行具有重要的公共卫生意义。
超重肥胖作为一种慢性复杂性疾病,其发生与发展是由多个基因参与,受多种因素影响的过程,并不遵从简单的孟德尔遗传模式。目前的研究已发现,遗传因素、环境因素、生命早期因素及生物因素等均影响超重肥胖的发生发展。胎儿起源学说或发育起源学说是生命早期因素如出生体重与随后的超重肥胖相关的理论基础。胎儿起源学说或发育起源学说基于这样的观念：如果在胚胎发育的敏感阶段发生损伤,细胞或组织生长轨迹会发生改变来补偿该损伤,则发生生物学程序化。生物学程序化使胎儿的生长状态可以影响出生后的健康结局。双生子的研究已发现,肥胖的遗传度为0.78。近些年来,利用全基因组关联研究已辨别出上百个肥胖相关位点,但至今为止鉴别出的遗传位点的累积效应只能解释约2\%的BMI总遗传变异。肥胖遗传度与基因变异的不一致性可能是由于基因位点间存在交互作用,如上位效应,或基因和环境因素间存在交互作用,即基因效应的发挥依赖于某环境暴露或陋习形成。研究发现,单个基因位点的多态性对肥胖发生发展的危险度较小,而多个基因位点多态性的联合作用和基因位点多态性与环境因素的联合作用却能显著增加肥胖发生发展的危险度。在目前关于基因位点多态性与肥胖的关系的众多研究中,得出了不一致甚至是相互矛盾的结果,可能是由于忽略了生命早期因素、基因与基因、基因与环境因素间的联合作用而引起的。因此,从生命早期因素、基因因素、环境因素及它们之间的交互作用角度探讨肥胖的发生发展,对于我们深入了解肥胖的机制具有重要意义。
[研究目的]
本研究探索生命早期的高出生体重对青少年期超重肥胖发生的影响,筛选与中国汉族青少年超重肥胖相关的基因多态性及单倍体型标志,以丰富和补充我国青少年超重肥胖易感性的生物标志,并探讨生命早期的高出生体重、遗传、环境因素间的交互作用,从而更全面的认识并解释超重肥胖发生发展的可能机制,为超重肥胖高危人群的识别及超重肥胖的预防干预措施的提出提供科学依据。
[研究方法]
本课题组在无锡惠山区、锡山区和江阴市建立有1993-1995年高出生体重出生队列。其中出生体重≥4000g的活产婴儿作为高出生体重暴露组,每一个高出生体重暴露对象配以一个同性别、同出生地区、同年出生的正常出生体重(2500-4000g)活产婴儿作为对照。该队列排除了死产、产后12天内死亡、先天性畸形、资料不全和随访困难者,最终有3230人纳入队列。本课题组分别于2005年10月至2007年1月和2010年10月至2012年4月对该出生队列进行了两次随访。本研究主要基于第二次的随访资料。第二次随访时,研究对象已进入青少年期,年龄主要集中在15-18岁。
基线资料的调查主要包括孕产妇的一般特征、初次孕产期检查情况、产前复查情况、围产期及新生儿情况等,基线资料来自于当地妇幼保健所的妇女围产期保健数据库。在青少年期的随访调查中主要分为四部分：问卷调查、体格检查、代谢相关生化指标检测及代谢相关基因多态位点的基因型鉴定。
调查问卷主要包括两部分：学生调查问卷和家长调查问卷。调查问卷主要调查学生及其家长的人口学一般特征、生长发育和心理情况、饮食情况、运动情况、生活方式、对肥胖的知识态度、个人及家族主要疾病史等。调查员均为统一培训的当地妇幼保健工作人员。按照WHO推荐的标准方法,现场对研究对象及其父母进行体格检查。体格检查的项目主要包括：身高、体重、血压、腰围、臀围等。
在本次随访中,并进一步进行了巢式病例对照研究。将队列中发生超重肥胖的对象(排除病理性肥胖)作为病例,依照年龄、性别配以体重正常者作为对照。对两组人群统一采集血液样本,进行代谢相关生化指标血清总胆固醇、甘油三酯、血糖、载脂蛋白A1、载脂蛋白B、HDL、胰岛素、C肽和瘦素等的检测,并提取DNA利用基质辅助激光解析电离时间飞行时间质谱、基因直接测序等方法对瘦素受体、FTO、MC4R等基因上的10个单核苷酸多态位点(瘦素受体基因rs146442768位点、rs1137100位点和rs8179183位点、UCP1基因rs3811791位点和rs1800592位点、PPAR8基因rs2016520位点、FTO基因rs9939609、rs1558902和rs8050136位点、MC4R基因rs17782313位点)进行基因型的测定。
利用Epidata软件建立数据库,双人双编录入数据。运用SAS9.2、MDR、SHEsis等软件对数据进行相关性分析、关联度估计、交互作用分析、连锁不平衡检验及单倍体分析等方面的统计学分析。
[研究结果]
1.研究对象的基本情况
原高出生体重队列包含研究对象3230人,本次随访到研究对象2302人,随访率为71.27\%,其中暴露组1156人,非暴露组1146人。本次随访时,研究对象主要集中在15-18岁,16、17岁者较多,占68.64\%；研究对象中男生居多,占65.25\%。超重肥胖者278人,超重肥胖率为12.08\%；男生和女生的超重肥胖率分别为12.18\%和11.88\%；15岁、16岁、17岁和18岁者的超重肥胖率分别为12.63\%、12.02\%、10.50\%和14.69\%。
2.高出生体重对青少年期超重肥胖、腰臀围、腹型肥胖、血压及代谢相关生化指标的影响
暴露组和非暴露组在青少年期超重肥胖发生率分别为14.88\%和9.25\%,两组超重肥胖发生率存在统计学差异(P{\textless}0.05),高出生体重者超重肥胖发生率是正常出生体重者的1.61倍(95\%CI=1.28,2.02)。在调整了性别、年龄、全家月总收入的影响后,该关联仍然存在(P{\textless}0.05)。
暴露组在青少年期胸围、腰围及臀围的均值分别为83.06cm、74.50cm、89.48cm,非暴露组分别为82.02cm、73.11cm、88.16cm,两组间存在统计学差异(P{\textless}0.05),暴露组在青少年期胸围、腰围及臀围均高于非暴露组。暴露组与非暴露组腰臀比均值均为0.83,未发现两组的腰臀比存在统计学差异(P{\textgreater}0.05)。
暴露组与非暴露组在青少年期腹型肥胖的发生率分别为15.83\%和9.77\%,两组间存在统计学差异(P{\textless}0.0001),暴露组在青少年期腹型肥胖的发生率是非暴露组的1.62倍(95\%CI=1.30,2.02)。按性别分层后,两组间腹型肥胖的发生情况仍然存在统计学差异(P{\textless}0.05)。
暴露组与非暴露组在青少年期血压偏高的发生率分别为12.98\%和12.57\%,未发现两组间血压偏高的发生情况存在统计学差异(P{\textgreater}0.05)。
经非参数Wilcoxon秩和检验,未发现暴露组与非暴露组间在青少年期血清总胆固醇、甘油三酯、空腹血糖、载脂蛋白A1、载脂蛋白B、高密度脂蛋白、C肽、胰岛素和瘦素存在统计学差异(P{\textgreater}0.05)。暴露组在青少年期胰岛素抵抗、胰岛细胞功能受损、胰岛素异常和C肽异常发生率分别为16.76\%、0.58\%、5.20\%和2.31\%,非暴露组分别为17.90\%、0.44\%、3.93\%和2.62\%,未发现两组间胰岛素抵抗、胰岛细胞功能受损、胰岛素异常和C肽异常发生情况存在统计学差异(P{\textgreater}0.05)。
3.环境因素及其间的交互作用对青少年期超重肥胖的影响
通过Logistic逐步回归分析发现,高出生体重(OR=1.80)、为独生子女(OR=1.84)、母亲受教育程度比较高(中等时OR=2.41,较高时OR=1.96)、每顿吃得很饱(OR=1.46)、经常吃膨化食品(OR=1.73)、经常吃西式快餐(OR=4.83)、双亲有一方肥胖(OR=1.64)或均肥胖者(OR=1.79)发生超重肥胖的风险较高。而进食速度较慢(OR=0.37)、食欲不好(OR=0.42)、个人反对肥胖(OR=0.52)、母亲反对肥胖(OR=0.56)、根据健康需求购买食物(OR=0.67)则是防止超重肥胖的保护因素。
利用潜类别分析将研究对象进行聚类,267人归属于饮食喜好不良组,56人归属于饮食习惯不良组,1731归属于饮食习惯良好组,247人归属于饮食习惯一般组,1人的饮食资料缺失。
MDR的结果显示,在影响青少年期超重肥胖的众多因素中,高出生体重与饮食喜好存在1阶交互作用,高出生体重、饮食喜好和双亲肥胖存在2阶交互作用,高出生体重、饮食喜好、年龄和肥胖态度存在3阶交互作用。以相乘模型为基础的交互作用分析结果显示,高出生体重与饮食喜好交互项的OR值为0.37,95\%CI为0.19-0.69,具有统计学差异(P=0.002)。而以相加模型为基础的交互作用分析结果显示,高出生体重与饮食喜好交互作用相对超额危险度RERI为-2.15(95\%CI=-4.55,0.26),尚不能认为高出生体重与饮食喜好间存在相加交互作用。
通过Logistic逐步回归分析发现,高出生体重(OR=1.75)、年龄较大(OR=1.25)、经常喝碳酸饮料(OR=1.56)、经常吃肉类食物(OR=1.59)、经常吃西式快餐(OR=1.69)、双亲有一方肥胖(OR=1.38)或均肥胖者(OR=1.62)、每天睡眠时间长者(OR=1.26)发生腹型肥胖的风险较高,而母亲受教育程度比较高(中等时OR=0.72,较高时OR=0.29)、食欲一般(OR=0.57)、个人反对肥胖(OR=0.57)、根据健康需求购买食物(OR=0.73)则是防止腹型肥胖的保护因素。

4.遗传因素及其间的交互作用对青少年期超重肥胖的影响

MDR方法、以相乘及相加模型为基础的交互作用分析均未发现这些基因位点多态性间存在着交互作用。
5.环境因素和遗传因素的交互作用对青少年期超重肥胖的影响
将环境及遗传因素均纳入Logistics回归模型进行分析,发现青少年超重肥胖的危险因素有FTO基因rs9939609位点突变、独生子女、母亲受教育程度较高、食欲好、经常吃西式快餐、双亲肥胖；青少年超重肥胖的保护因素包括进餐速度中等或偏慢、个人不认可肥胖。
MDR模型交互作用效应图显示,年龄与UCP1基因rs3811791位点多态、饮食喜好与FTO基因rs9939609位点多态、体育活动时间与静坐时间可能分别存在交互作用。以相乘模型为基础的交互作用分析显示,体育活动时间*静坐时间交互项的OR值为1.99,95\%CI为1.18-3.37,有统计学差异(P=0.010)；没有发现年龄与rs3811791位点多态、饮食喜好与rs9939609位点多态存在相乘交互作用(P{\textgreater}0.05),但在调整了其它环境和遗传因素的影响后,发现年龄*rs3811791位点多态交互项具有统计学意义(P=0.008),OR为2.00(95\%CI=1.20,3.36)。以相加模型为基础的交互作用分析显示,体育活动时间与静坐时间存在相加交互作用。体育活动时间少静坐时间长者超重肥胖的发生风险是体育活动时间多静坐时间短者的1.86倍(95\%CI=1.32,2.62),RERI为0.92,其95\%CI为0.35-1.48。由于该交互作用的存在使体育活动时间少静坐时间长者发生超重肥胖的额外风险是体育活动时间多静坐时间短者的0.92倍。AP为50\%,表明体育活动时间少静坐时间长者中,发生超重肥胖的危险性归因于两者交互作用的比例为50\%。而未发现年龄与UCP1基因rs3811791位点多态、饮食喜好与FTO基因rs9939609位点多态间存在相加交互作用。
6.高出生体重与青少年超重肥胖关联的潜在机制分析
瘦素受体基因rs8179183位点、FTO基因rs9939609位点、rs1558902位点、rs8050136位点的单核苷酸多态性与青少年期超重肥胖的发生有关(P{\textless}0.05),而未发现其与出生体重存在相关性(P{\textgreater}0.05)。MC4R基因rs17782313位点的单核苷酸多态性与高出生体重存在关联(P{\textless}0.05),TC/CC基因型携带者高出生体重的发生风险要高于TT基因型携带者,是其的1.53倍(95\%CI=1.01,2.33),而未发现其与青少年期超重肥胖的发生有关(P{\textgreater}0.05)。
[结论]
1.与正常出生体重者相比,高出生体重者在青少年期超重肥胖的发生风险增加；出生体重与青少年期胸围、腰围、臀围、腹型肥胖的发生存在相关性,而与青少年期血压和代谢相关生化指标无关。
2.影响青少年超重肥胖的环境因素可能有：高出生体重、独生子女、母亲受教育程度、每顿吃得很饱、进餐速度、食欲、吃膨化食品、吃西式快餐、个人对肥胖的态度、母亲对肥胖的态度、是否根据健康需求购买食物、双亲肥胖状况。其中高出生体重与饮食喜好具有负相乘交互作用,即高出生体重者同时具有不良饮食喜好时,其在青少年期发生超重肥胖的风险要低于高出生体重和不良饮食喜好各自引起个体的超重肥胖风险之和。
3.瘦素受体基因rs8179183位点、FTO基因rs9939609位点、rs1558902位点、rs8050136位点的单核苷酸多态性与青少年期超重肥胖的发生可能有关。FTO基因rs9939609、rs1558902、rs8050136三个位点之间完全连锁不平衡,由这三个位点组成的TTC和AAA单倍体型和由瘦素受体基因SNPs位点rs1137100和rs8179183组成的AC单倍体型与青少年超重肥胖存在相关性。本研究所测的这些基因位点多态性间可能并不存在交互作用。
4.体育活动时间与静坐时间可能存在交互作用。
5.瘦素受体基因rs1137100位点、rs146442768位点和rs8179183位点、UCP1基因rs1800592位点和rs3811791位点、PPARδ基因rs2016520位点、FTO基因rs9939609、rs1558902位点和rs8050136位点、MC4R基因rs17782313位点的多态性不是高出生体重和青少年期超重肥胖共同的遗传基础,它们不是影响高出生体重和青少年超重肥胖相关联的潜在机制。},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite guidelines recommending the use of formal tests of interaction in subgroup analyses in clinical trials, inappropriate subgroup-specific analyses continue. Moreover, trials designed to detect overall treatment effects have limited power to detect treatment-subgroup interactions. This article quantifies the error rates associated with subgroup analyses.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Simulations quantified the risks of misinterpreting subgroup analyses as evidence of differential subgroup effects and the limited power of the interaction test in trials designed to detect overall treatment effects.
RESULTS: Although formal interaction tests performed as expected with respect to false positives, subgroup-specific tests were considerably less reliable: A significant effect in one subgroup only was observed in 7\% to 64\% of simulations depending on trial characteristics. Regarding power of the interaction test, a trial with 80\% power for the overall effect had only 29\% power to detect an interaction effect of the same magnitude. For interactions of this size to be detected with the same power as the overall effect, sample sizes should be inflated fourfold, increasing dramatically for interactions smaller than 20\% of the overall effect.
CONCLUSION: Although it is generally recognized that subgroup analyses can produce spurious results, the extent of the problem may be underestimated.},

The causes of MS are not known; however, the incidence of MS is increasing, thereby suggesting that changes in lifestyle and/or environmental factors may be responsible. On this background, the Environmental Risk Factors in MS Study or EnvIMS study was designed to further explore the etiology of MS. The design and methodology are described, providing details to enable investigators to (i) use our experiences to design their own studies; (ii) take advantage of, and build on the methodological work completed for, the EnvIMS study; (iii) become aware of this data source that is available for use by the research community.
METHODS: EnvIMS is a multinational case-control study, enrolling 2,800 cases with MS and 5,012 population-based controls in Canada, Italy, Norway, Serbia and Sweden. The study was designed to investigate the most commonly implicated risk factors for MS etiology using a self-report questionnaire.
RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The use of a common methodology to study MS etiology across several countries enhances the comparability of results in different geographic regions and research settings, reduces the resources required for study design and enhances the opportunity for data harmonization.},

	volume = {50},

	doi = {10.1002/art.20553},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The main genetic risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the shared epitope (SE) of HLA-DR, while smoking is an important environmental risk factor. We studied a potential gene-environment interaction between SE genes and smoking in the etiology of the 2 major subgroups of RA: rheumatoid factor (RF)-seropositive and RF-seronegative disease.
METHODS: A population-based case-control study involving incident cases of RF-seropositive and RF-seronegative RA (858 cases and 1,048 controls) was performed in Sweden. Cases and controls were classified according to their cigarette smoking status and HLA-DRB1 genotypes. The relative risk of developing RA was calculated for different gene/smoking combinations and was compared with the relative risk in never smokers without SE genes.
RESULTS: The relative risk of RF-seropositive RA was 2.8 (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 1.6-4.8) in never smokers with SE genes, 2.4 (95\% CI 1.3-4.6) in current smokers without SE genes, and 7.5 (95\% CI 4.2-13.1) in current smokers with SE genes. Smokers carrying double SE genes displayed a relative risk of RF-seropositive RA of 15.7 (95\% CI 7.2-34.2). The interaction between smoking and SE genes was significant, as measured by the attributable proportion due to interaction, which was 0.4 (95\% CI 0.2-0.7) for smoking and any SE, and 0.6 (95\% CI 0.4-0.9) for smoking and a double SE. Neither smoking nor SE genes nor the combination of these factors increased the risk of developing RF-seronegative RA.
CONCLUSION: The disease risk of RF-seropositive RA associated with one of the classic genetic risk factors for immune-mediated diseases (the SE of HLA-DR) is strongly influenced by the presence of an environmental factor (smoking) in the population at risk.},

	abstract = {Context: Evidence supports a protective effect of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) on bone. However, whether genetic susceptibility modifies the association of HT and fracture risk is not sufficiently explored.
Objective: The objective was to test an interaction between genetic susceptibility and HT on fracture risk.
Design: We constructed two weighted genetic risk scores (GRSs) based on 16 fracture-associated variants (Fx-GRSs) and 50 bone mineral density variants (BMD-GRSs). We used Cox regression to estimate the main effects of GRSs and their interactions with HT on fracture risk. We estimated the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) as a measure of additive interaction. We also used the case-only approach to test for a multiplicative interaction.
Setting: Forty US clinical centers.
Participants: A total of 9922 genotyped white postmenopausal women (age, 50 to 79) from the Women's Health Initiative HT randomized trials.
Main Outcome Measures: Adjudicated fracture incidence.
Results: Both GRSs were associated with fracture risk per 1-unit increment in GRS (hazard ratio, 1.04 [95\% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.06] for Fx-GRS and hazard ratio, 1.03 [95\% confidence interval,1.02-1.04] for BMD-GRS). We found no evidence for multiplicative interaction for either of the GRS. However, we observed a substantial additive interaction, where the highest quartile of both GRSs and randomization to placebo have excess fracture risk: Fx-GRS P for RERI = 0.047, BMD-GRS P for RERI = 0.046.
Conclusions: These results suggest that HT reduces fracture risk in postmenopausal women, especially in those at highest genetic risk of fracture and low BMD.},

	abstract = {Background Low socioeconomic position (SEP) and family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) contribute to increased T2DM risk, but it is unclear whether they exacerbate each other’s effect. This study examined whether SEP reinforces the association of T2DM family history with T2DM, and whether behavioural and clinical risk factors can explain this reinforcement.
Methods We used cross-sectional data on 51 725 participants from Lifelines. SEP was measured as educational level and was self-reported, just as family history of T2DM. T2DM was diagnosed based on measured fasting plasma glucose and glycated haemoglobin, combined with self-reported disease and recorded medication use. We assessed interaction on the additive scale by calculating the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI).
Results ORs of T2DM were highest for males (4.37; 95\% CI 3.47 to 5.51) and females (7.77; 5.71 to 10.56) with the combination of low SEP and a family history of T2DM. The RERIs of low SEP and a family history of T2DM were 0.64 (−0.33 to 1.62) for males and 3.07 (1.53 to 4.60) for females. Adjustment for behavioural and clinical risk factors attenuated associations and interactions, but risks remained increased.
Conclusion Low SEP and family history of T2DM are associated with T2DM, but they also exacerbate each other’s impact in females but not in males. Behavioural and clinical risk factors partly explain these gender differences, as well as the associations underlying the interaction in females. The exacerbation by low SEP of T2DM risks in T2DM families deserves attention in prevention and community care.},

	abstract = {Hyperuricemia is associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS), but the association is often confounded by the shared background of obesity. We sought to explore the modifying effects of obesity on the association between uric acid (UA), MetS components, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)., We conducted a cross-sectional study in a Chinese population of 10,069 participants aged ≥20 years. Multiplicative interaction between obesity (BMI ≥25 kg/m2) and elevated UA was assessed using an interaction term in a logistic regression analysis. The presence of additive interaction was assessed based on the relative excess risk due to the interaction (RERI) and the attributable proportion due to the interaction (AP)., There was no evidence of a multiplicative interaction between obesity and elevated UA on MetS components and NAFLD. However, there was a strong additive interaction between obesity and elevated UA with regard to NAFLD (RERI of 6.47 [95\% CI 3.42–9.53] for men and 5.87 [1.55–10.19] for women) and hypertriglyceridemia (RERI of 1.38 [0.57–2.20] for men and 1.38 [0.08–2.67] for women). In addition, 42\% and 36\% of the increased odds of NAFLD for men and women, respectively, can be explained by an interaction between obesity and elevated UA (AP of 0.42 [95\% CI (0.30–0.54)] for men and 0.36 [0.17–0.55] for women). Similarly, the interaction accounted for 27\% and 26\% of the increased risk of hypertriglyceridemia for men and women (AP of 0.27 [0.14–0.41] for men and 0.26 [0.06–0.47] for women)., In this population, obesity and elevated UA synergistically interacted to increase the risk of NAFLD and hypertriglyceridemia.},

OBJECTIVES: To examine the interaction between smoking and infectious mononucleosis (IM) in the risk of MS.
METHODS: Within the case-control study on Environmental Factors In Multiple Sclerosis (EnvIMS), 1904 MS patients and 3694 population-based frequency-matched healthy controls from Norway, Italy, and Sweden reported on prior exposure to smoking and history of IM. We examined the interaction between the two exposures on the additive and multiplicative scale.
RESULTS: Smoking and IM were each found to be associated with an increased MS risk in all three countries, and there was a negative multiplicative interaction between the two exposures in each country separately as well as in the pooled analysis ( p = 0.001). Among those who reported IM, there was no increased risk associated with smoking (odds ratio (OR): 0.95, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-1.37). The direction of the estimated interactions on the additive scale was consistent with a negative interaction in all three countries (relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI): -0.98, 95\% CI: -2.05-0.15, p = 0.09).
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate competing antagonism, where the two exposures compete to affect the outcome.},

	abstract = {先天性心脏病是最常见和最严重的出生缺陷之一,也是我国大部分地区5岁以下儿童的主要死亡原因,其发病机制至今尚未完全阐明。目前多数研究认为它是一种由遗传因素和环境因素共同作用所致的复杂性疾病。就环境危险因素而言,父母孕前及母亲孕早期暴露的多种有毒有害理化因素、服用的药物、疾病等都被认为与先心病的发生有紧密的联系,然而,即使暴露在相同的环境因素下,不同个体之间发病的危险性仍然存在很大差异,环境因素的效应很大程度上还取决于个体的遗传易感性,但既往的流行病学研究多数单独针对环境因素,对个体本身的易感性差异却没有引起足够的重视。同时,由于病例对照研究大多在产后收集资料,可能存在严重的回忆偏倚,导致研究结果可信度低,而这些均是造成不同研究之间结论各异的重要原因。 	针对于此,本课题首先采用Meta分析探讨中国人群先天性心脏病发生的主要危险因素,为进一步的病因学探索提供依据。在此基础上,采用个体匹配的病例对照研究方法,通过流行病学问卷调查,探讨父母孕前及母亲孕期暴露的环境危险因素与子代先心病发生的关系；通过实验室检测,探讨母亲及子代的相代谢酶基因GSTM1、GSTT1多态性与先心病易感性的关系；在上述研究的基础上,探讨环境因素与个体的遗传易感性间的交互作用,以确定代谢酶基因多态性是否会引起环境暴露致病危险性的差异。同时,为了克服既往病例对照研究中采用单一对照形式可能产生的回忆偏倚,选择健康儿童和除先心病外其他出生缺陷的儿童两种对照,以期提高研究质量和结果的可信度,为进一步阐明环境因素的致病机制及开展先心病的个性化预防提供依据。 	第一部分：中国人群先天性心脏病危险因素的Meta分析 	目的：探讨中国人群先天性心脏病发生的主要危险因素,为先心病预防及本课题进一步的病因学探索提供依据。 	方法：收集1993年1月至2013年2月国内外公开发表的关于中国人群先天性心脏病危险因素的病例对照研究文献,应用Stata12.0软件中的Meta分析模块对纳入的文献数据进行分析。 	结果:共纳入19篇文献(累计病例4769例,对照6720例)。单因素分析的合并OR值及其95\%可信区间分别为：母亲孕早期发热(OR=3.64,95\%CI:2.19-6.04)、孕早期接触有毒物质(OR=3.34,95\%CI:2.62-4.25).有自然流产史(OR=3.03,95\%CI:1.14-8.03).孕早期服用抗生素(OR=2.49,95\%CI:1.80-3.45).孕期受精神刺激(OR=2.26,95\%CI:1.66-3.06).孕早期噪声刺激(OR=2.15,95\%CI:1.34-3.43).孕早期感冒(OR=2.09,95\%CI:1.67-2.63).有不良妊娠史(OR=1.81,95\%CI:1.44-2.29).孕早期被动吸烟(OR=1.69,95\%CI:1.11-2.57).孕早期服解热镇痛药(OR=2.52,95\%CI:0.68-9.28).孕早期接触宠物(OR=2.30,95\%CI:0.31-16.84).父亲吸烟(OR=1.38,95\%CI:0.94-2.02);多因素分析的合并OR值及其95\%可信区间分别为：母亲孕早期感冒(OR=3.56,95\%CI:1.93-6.55).孕期受精神刺激(OR=2.69,95\%CI:1.38-5.22).孕早期接触有毒物质(OR=2.61,95\%CI:1.96-3.46)、有不良妊娠史(OR=1.76,95\%CI:1.37-2.26)。 	结论：母亲孕早期发热、孕早期接触有毒物质、有自然流产史、有不良妊娠史、孕早期服用抗生素、孕期受精神刺激、孕早期噪声刺激、孕早期感冒、孕早期被动吸烟史是先心病发生的危险因素,而母亲孕早期服用解热镇痛药、孕早期接触宠物、父亲吸烟与先心病间的关联需要进一步研究。 	第二部分：先天性心脏病环境危险因素的筛选 	目的：探讨父母孕前及母亲孕早期暴露的相关环境因素与子代先心病发生的关系。 	方法：采用以医院为基础的病例对照研究。选择2011年10月～2013年1月,在山东省济宁医学院第一附属医院心外科就诊的0-7周岁单纯性先心病(指不伴有其他器官的畸形)患儿204例作为病例组,按照1：1个体匹配的方法(匹配条件：年龄与病例相差±8个月,性别相同),选择与病例在同一家医院儿科因感冒、腹泻、外伤等就诊或住院的健康儿童204例作为健康对照组。通过流行病学调查问卷收集父母孕前及母亲孕早期相关环境因素的暴露情况,采用条件Logistic回归分析研究暴露因素和先心病间的关联强度。 	结果：204例先心病各类型的构成依次为室间隔缺损(VSD)94例(46.08\%)、房间隔缺损(ASD)26例(12.75\%)、复杂型先心病(合并至少2种类型者)25例(12.25\%)、其他单纯型先心病25例(12.25\%)、动脉导管未闭(PDA)24例(11.76\%)、法洛氏四联症(F4)10例(4.90\%)。多因素条件Logistic回归分析表明,按照a=0.05的水准,母亲有不良妊娠史(OR=3.06)、孕早期接触农药(OR=3.57)、孕早期接触宠物(OR=4.86)、孕前3个月内被动吸烟(OR=2.16)、孕早期被动吸烟(OR=2.41)、孕早期感冒(OR=2.19)、孕早期发烧(38℃以上)(OR=2.20)、孕早期服用解热镇痛药(OR=2.78)、孕早期居住在3年内装修过的居室(OR=2.57)、居住点周围1公里内有工厂(OR=2.22)、孕期生活事件应激量得分{\textgreater}375分(OR=2.18)、母亲孕前三个月内从事以体力劳动为主的职业(OR=4.38)、父亲在孕前3个月内接触农药(OR=2.25)及被动吸烟(OR=1.79)是先心病发生的危险因素；而父母文化程度高、母亲孕早期肉禽鱼类摄入频率≥3次/周(OR=0.55)、动物内脏摄入频率≥3次、周(OR=0.37)、在孕前3个月至孕后3个月内服用过叶酸(OR=0.38)、孕前做检查(OR=0.50)是先心病发生的保护因素。 	结论：父母孕前及母亲孕早期应尽量避免或减少上述环境危险因素的暴露,同时重视孕前检查、加强孕期营养均衡及增补叶酸,对于预防子代先心病的发生具有重要意义。 	第三部分：病例对照研究中环境因素潜在回忆偏倚的评估 	目的：通过加入阳性对照,控制可能存在的回忆偏倚,对与健康对照比较时筛选出的环境危险因素进行进一步验证。 	方法：采用病例对照研究。按照1：1个体匹配(年龄与病例相差±8个月,性别相同)的方法为病例组匹配阳性对照,具体选择与病例组患儿在同一家医院的康复科接受治疗的非先心病以及未合并先心病的其他出生缺陷儿童。将第一部分研究筛选出的与先心病显著相关的变量纳入本部分研究,采用条件Logistic回归分析,通过比较病例组与两个对照组分别计算出的效应值,观察显著性关联在病例组与阳性对照组相比较时是否消失,判断回忆偏倚的影响,从而进一步验证相关因素与先心病的关联。 	结果：纳入本部分分析的研究对象为病例、健康对照、阳性对照各176例。病例组与健康对照组比较时,纳入分析的16个变量在调整混杂因素后与先心病均仍有显著性关联。病例组与阳性对照组比较时,母亲孕期生活事件应激量得分(OR病例vS健康对照=2.20,95\%CI=1.04-4.64；OR病例vS阳性对照=1.31,95\%CI=0.69-2.51)、父亲孕前3个月内接触农药(OR病例VS健康对照=2.42,95\%CI=1.23-4.74；OR病例VS阳性对照=1.22,95\%CI=0.76-2.95)与先心病间的关联强度明显减弱且不再具有统计学意义。而母亲孕前3个月内被动吸烟、孕早期被动吸烟、孕早期居住在3年内装修过的居室、母亲有不良妊娠史、母亲孕早期接触农药、孕早期接触宠物、孕早期感冒、孕早期发烧、孕早期服用解热镇痛药、孕早期肉禽鱼类摄入频率、动物内脏摄入频率、孕前3个月至孕后3个月内服用叶酸、孕前检查及父亲孕前3个月内被动吸烟这14个变量与先心病间的显著性关联均未消失。 	结论：第一部分研究筛选出的环境因素中,母亲孕期生活事件应激量得分、父亲孕前3个月内接触农药与子代先心病的发生之间是否存在关联需做进一步探讨,而其余因素在控制回忆偏倚之后与先心病间的显著性关联均仍然存在。 	第四部分：母亲及子代GSTM1、 	GSTT1基因多态性与先天性心脏病易感性的相关研究 	目的：探讨母亲及子代的相代谢酶基因GSTM1、GSTT1多态性与先天性心脏病易感性之间的关联。 	方法：采集病例组和健康对照组研究对象的非抗凝血及其母亲的口腔黏膜上皮细胞。提取基因组DNA后,应用PCR技术检测研究对象及其母亲的GSTM1、 GSTT1基因多态性。 	结果：(1)对母亲两种基因单独进行分析的结果显示：GSTM1缺失基因型在病例组母亲和健康对照组母亲中的分布频率分别为55.3\%和51.0\%,经,检验,两组间差异无统计学意义(P=0.54)；GSTT1缺失基因型在病例组母亲和健康对照组母亲中的分布频率分别为53.4\%和41.7\%,经,检验,两组间差异无统计学意义(P=0.10)。 	(2)对母亲两种基因联合效应的分析结果显示：病例组母亲携带GSTM1、 GSTT1联合缺失基因型的频率(34.0\%)明显高于对照组母亲(19.8\%),差别具有统计学意义(P=0.03),进一步的分析结果显示,母亲携带GSTM1、GSTT1联合缺失基因型时,其子代发生先心病的风险是携带两基因正常基因型者的1.86倍(P{\textless}0.05,OR=1.86,95\%CI=1.02-3.38)。 	(3)对子代两种基因单独进行分析的结果显示：GSTM1缺失基因型在病例组和健康对照组中的分布频率分别为52.2\%和47.8\%,经,检验,两组间无明显差异(P=0.40)；GSTT1缺失基因型在病例组和健康对照组中的的分布频率分别为53.9\%和52.2\%,经χ2检验,两组间无明显差异(P=0.75)；无论是病例组还是对照组,GSTM1、GSTT1基因型在不同性别中的分布均无显著性差异(P{\textgreater}0.05)。 	(4)对子代两种基因联合效应的分析结果显示：同时携带此两种缺失基因型的频率在病例组(31.1\%)稍高于健康对照组(24.2\%),但经χ2检验,差异无统计学意义(P=0.14)。 	结论：母亲携带GSTM1、GSTT1联合缺失的基因型会增加子代发生先天性心脏病的危险性。 	第五部分：先天性心脏病中易感基因和环境因素间交互作用的研究 	目的：探讨母亲及子代的GSTM1、GSTT1基因多态性与相关环境因素在先心病中的交互作用。 	方法：在前三部分研究的基础上,将筛选出的与先心病发生有关、并需要经过体内代谢酶进行生物转化的环境因素与母亲及子代的GSTM1、GSTT1基因进行交互作用分析。在叉生分析的基础上,利用Logistic回归模型计算出基因与环境因素各种不同组合下的OR值,并代入相加模型,定性判断基因-环境之间的相加交互作用。同时通过计算相加模型三个指标(RERI、AP、S)及其可信区间,对该交互作用进行定量分析及显著性检验。 	结果：纳入分析的环境因素包括母亲孕前3个月内被动吸烟、孕早期被动吸烟、孕早期服用解热镇痛药、孕早期居住在3年内装修的居室以及居住点周围有工厂5个因素。(1)子代的GSTM1、GSTT1联合缺失基因型与上述5个环境因素间均具有正相加交互作用,其中,该联合缺失基因型与母亲孕早期服用解热镇痛药(RERI=3.65,AP=50\%,S=2.36)、居住点周围有工厂(RERI=3.37,AP=61\%,S=3.98)这2个变量间的正相加交互作用经显著性检验具有统计学意义。 	(2)子代的GSTM1基因多态性与母亲孕早期居住在3年内装修的居室、居住点周围有工厂之间、母亲的GSTM1基因多态性与孕早期服用解热镇痛药之间均具有正相加交互作用,但经显著性检验,均没有统计学意义。 	(3)其他基因与环境因素的不同组合在先心病中均未发现具有正相加交互作用。 	结论：子代携带GSTM1和GSTT1联合缺失基因型与母亲孕早期服用解热镇痛药、居住点周围有工厂对先心病的发生均有正相加交互作用。},

Prognostic significance of each protein was examined by single-marker and multimarker Cox regression analyses. To reclassify the prognostic risk groups, significant protein biomarkers on single-marker analysis were incorporated into an RPA model consisting of the same clinical variables (age, Karnofsky Performance Status, extent of resection, and neurologic function) as the existing RTOG RPA. The new RPA model (NRG-GBM-RPA) was confirmed using traditional immunohistochemistry in an independent data set (n = 176).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Main Outcomes and Measures{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Overall survival (OS).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In 452 specimens, MGMT (hazard ratio [HR], 1.81; 95\% CI, 1.37-2.39;\textit{P} \&lt; .001), survivin (HR, 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.76;\textit{P} = .02), c-Met (HR, 1.53; 95\% CI, 1.06-2.23;\textit{P} = .02), pmTOR (HR, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.60-0.97;\textit{P} = .03), and Ki-67 (HR, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.78;\textit{P} = .007) protein levels were found to be significant on single-marker multivariate analysis of OS. To refine the existing RPA, significant protein biomarkers together with clinical variables (age, Karnofsky Performance Status, extent of resection, and neurological function) were incorporated into a new model. Of 166 patients used for the new NRG-GBM-RPA model, 97 (58.4\%) were male (mean [SD] age, 55.7 [12.0] years). Higher MGMT protein level was significantly associated with decreased\textit{MGMT}promoter methylation and vice versa (1425.1 for methylated vs 1828.0 for unmethylated;\textit{P} \&lt; .001). Furthermore, MGMT protein expression (HR, 1.84; 95\% CI, 1.38-2.43;\textit{P} \&lt; .001) had greater prognostic value for OS compared with\textit{MGMT}promoter methylation (HR, 1.77; 95\% CI, 1.28-2.44;\textit{P} \&lt; .001). The refined NRG-GBM-RPA consisting of MGMT protein, c-Met protein, and age revealed greater separation of OS prognostic classes compared with the existing clinically based RPA model and\textit{MGMT}promoter methylation in NRG Oncology RTOG 0525. The prognostic significance of the NRG-GBM-RPA was subsequently confirmed in an independent data set (n = 176).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions and Relevance{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}This new NRG-GBM-RPA model improves outcome stratification over both the current RTOG RPA model and\textit{MGMT}promoter methylation, respectively, for patients with GBM treated with radiation and temozolomide and was biologically validated in an independent data set. The revised RPA has the potential to contribute to improving the accurate assessment of prognostic groups in patients with GBM treated with radiation and temozolomide and to influence clinical decision making.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Trial Registration{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:NCT00304031{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {全基因组关联研究(genome-wide association study, GWAS)从2005年起初露锋芒，至今方兴未艾，成果斐然。然而，目前GWAS所识别的具有主效应的位点仅能解释一小部分遗传变异。复杂疾病由外在环境暴露因素、内在遗传因素相互影响所致。基因组学研究中忽视基因—环境、基因—基因交互作用是导致遗传性缺失(missing heritability)的重要原因之一。 	GWAS涉及的变量数高达数十万。传统交互作用分析方法受算法复杂程度、软件计算速度等限制，无法在全基因组水平检测交互作用。2007年以来，涌现出一大批针对高维基因组学数据基因—基因交互作用分析的方法。不同方法各有利弊，且缺乏专门快速检测高阶交互作用的方法。本文首先，对多种交互作用分析方法进行系统评价；其次，改进方法，提出新的高阶交互作用分析方法；再次，探索高维数据中高阶交互作用降维分析策略；最后，应用研究所得策略在实际GWAS资料中进行交互作用挖掘。全文结构如下： 	第Ⅰ部分交互作用分析方法的系统性评价。基于文献综述，系统评价了性能出色、算法典型的10种方法(7种软件)，包括：BOOST、BiForce、iLOCi、SIXPAC\_D、 SIXPAC\_R、 SIXPAC\_lod、 SNPRuler、 AntEpiSeeker\_pruned、AntEpiSeeker\_raw、TEAM。模拟试验一、模拟试验二分别考察各方法检出1对、多对交互作用的性能。BOOST、BiForce两法检测交互作用时一类错误可控，把握度尚可；BOOST与BiForce性能完全相同，提示“先初筛、再检验”是合理的降维分析方式。位点2分类编码的SIXPAC\_lod仅在检测多对交互作用时，一类错误膨胀至15\%左右，但把握度总是高于BOOST、BiForce。提示样本量较低时，位点可采用2分类编码进行初筛，后续再检验。BOOST、BiForce位点编码方式较SIXPAC\_lod更灵活，因此建议实际应用时，视条件灵活应用这两个软件。AntEpiSeeker\_raw、TEAM检测无任何效应位点时，一类错误可控；只要位点有主效应或者交互作用，两法均具有较高的把握度，适合过滤噪音位点。模拟试验三显示BOOST、BiForce计算速度快，可在短时间内完成检测工作。 	第Ⅱ部分基于熵的交互作用分析方法改进。基于信息论(information theory)，提出迭代熵交互作用(iterative entropy epistasis, IEE)法，用于检测高阶交互作用，且适应位点不同的连锁不平衡(linkage disequilibrium, LD)结构。从方法学(模拟试验四)、实际应用(模拟试验五)角度，无论检测一阶、高阶交互作用，IEE法一类错误控制能力与对数线性模型相近，但把握度优于后者。此外，IEE法计算速度快于对数线性模型。模拟试验六显示，若进一步降低IEE法迭代收敛精度，可再次提高计算速度。检测一阶、二阶以上交互作用时，IEE法分别在原始迭代次数25\%、50\%条件下，可维持原始一类错误、把握度水平；分别提高3倍、1倍计算速度。 	第Ⅲ部分高阶交互作用降维分析策略研究。提出“KSA初筛→IEE再筛→logistic检验, KIL”交互作用降维分析策略。模拟试验七研究显示：不同条件下，KSA法统计量总是不低于IEE法统计量，且计算速度最快，符合快速初筛原则；IEE法速度快于logistic回归，适合高维数据筛选。模拟试验八显示，与单纯应用logistic回归相比，利用KIL策略降维分析，可以控制一类错误，且能够基本维持把握度(平均达到logistic回归效能的92\%以上)、减轻计算负担(仅为原始计算量的30\%-40\%)。 	第Ⅳ部分肺癌全基因组关联研究数据挖掘。应用研究所得策略，在中国人群肺癌GWAS实际资料中全基因组水平检测交互作用。 	(1)基因—基因交互作用分析。采用三阶段病例—对照研究设计。第一阶段为GWAS筛选期，第二、三阶段为独立的验证期。总样本量为13,392(6,377例病例、7,015例对照)，涉及591,370个位点。GWAS筛选阶段，采用KIL策略获得4对潜在交互作用位点。交互作用位点rs2562796-rs16832404在后续验证中成功。GWAS筛选阶段，其交互作用OR=2.58,95\%CI=2.24-2.97, P=1.37×10-39；第一阶段验证，交互作用OR=1.17,95\%CI=0.99-1.38, P=6.37×10-2；第二阶段验证，交互作用OR=1.21,95\%CI=1.06-1.38, P=4.61×10-3。总样本中，交互作用OR=1.33,95\%CI=1.23-1.43, P=1.03×10-13)。按年龄、性别、吸烟等因素分层分析，该交互作用位点在不同亚人群中仍具有统计学意义。基因填补分析显示，位点所在区域附近有成簇交互作用信号。 	(2)基因—环境交互作用分析。采用两阶段病例—对照设计。样本来源同第(1)节第一、二阶段。共8,440例样本(3,865例病例、4,575例病例)。GWAS筛选阶段获得6个与吸烟存在交互作用的位点，其中rs1316298、rs4589502验证成功。GWAS筛选阶段位点rs1316298、rs4589502与吸烟的交互作用P值分别为4.15×10-5、2.61×10-5。第一阶段验证，交互作用P值分别为8.87×10-4、4.40×10-2。位点rs1316298与吸烟存在拮抗型(antagonistic)交互作用；位点rs4589502与吸烟存在协同型(synergetic)交互作用，总样本中P值分别为6.73×10-6、3.84×10-6。基因填补分析显示，两位点的附近区域有簇的交互作用信号。 	(3)生物学通路基因富集分析。以生物学通路为功能单位，降维交互作用分析。采用两阶段病例—对照设计。第一阶段为GWAS南京子研究，用于筛选通路，第二阶段为GWAS北京子研究，用于验证通路。共5408例样本(2,331例病例、3,077例对照)。基于KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)、BioCarta通路数据库中368个通路，筛选、验证获得4条生物学通路。总样本中结果分别为：achPathway (P=0.012)、At1rPathway (P=0.022)、metPathway (P=0.010)和rac1Pathway (P=0.005)。敏感性分析显示4条通路关联分析结果较为稳定。保留富集在通路上的基因及其代表性位点。进一步，分别在4条通路内检测基因—基因、基因—吸烟交互作用，获得1对交互作用位点(rs17057065、rs17194885)。交互作用在南京子研究、北京子研究、总样本中P值分别为4.98×10-2、4.42×10-2、4.69×10-3。 	模拟试验及实例验证共同提示：KIL是行之有效的交互作用降维分析策略。基因、环境之间相互影响，共同导致肺癌风险。 	本文的主要创新点： 	(1)系统评价方法。系统评价了10种交互作用分析方法在多种条件下的一类错误、把握度。探索各方法的优缺点及其适用条件，为实际资料分析，提供了方法选择的参考依据。 	(2)创新筛选方法。创新提出了高阶交互作用分析方法(IEE法)。评价了多种条件下IEE法的统计学性质，以及不同迭代精度对统计学性质的影响。IEE法可作为大规模快速筛选的工具。 	(3)提出降维策略。提出了KIL高阶交互作用降维分析策略，评价了其合理性及有效性。 	(4)理论指导应用。在中国人群肺癌GWAS实际资料中，首次进行了全基因组水平的基因—基因、基因—环境交互作用分析及以生物学通路为功能单位的降维交互作用分析，为后续肺癌机制研究提供了统计学证据。},

Eligible articles had to report on cohorts of patients with epilepsy who were seizure-free and had started withdrawal of antiepileptic drugs; articles also had to contain information regarding seizure recurrences during and after withdrawal. We excluded surgical cohorts, reports with fewer than 30 patients, and reports on acute symptomatic seizures because these topics were beyond the scope of our objective. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies system. Data analysis was based on individual participant data. Survival curves and proportional hazards were computed. The strongest predictors were selected with backward selection. Models were converted to nomograms and a web-based tool to determine individual risks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We identified 45 studies with 7082 patients; ten studies (22\%) with 1769 patients (25\%) were included in the meta-analysis. Median follow-up was 5·3 years (IQR 3·0–10·0, maximum 23 years). Prospective and retrospective studies and randomised controlled trials were included, covering non-selected and selected populations of both children and adults. Relapse occurred in 812 (46\%) of 1769 patients; 136 (9\%) of 1455 for whom data were available had seizures in their last year of follow-up, suggesting enduring seizure control was not regained by this timepoint. Independent predictors of seizure recurrence were epilepsy duration before remission, seizure-free interval before antiepileptic drug withdrawal, age at onset of epilepsy, history of febrile seizures, number of seizures before remission, absence of a self-limiting epilepsy syndrome, developmental delay, and epileptiform abnormality on electroencephalogram (EEG) before withdrawal. Independent predictors of seizures in the last year of follow-up were epilepsy duration before remission, seizure-free interval before antiepileptic drug withdrawal, number of antiepileptic drugs before withdrawal, female sex, family history of epilepsy, number of seizures before remission, focal seizures, and epileptiform abnormality on EEG before withdrawal. Adjusted concordance statistics were 0·65 (95\% CI 0·65–0·66) for predicting seizure recurrence and 0·71 (0·70–0·71) for predicting long-term seizure freedom.

	abstract = {The increasing availability of sophisticated methods to characterize human genetic variation has enabled pharmacogenetic data to be used not only to predict responses to treatment (in the context of so-called personalized medicine), but also to identify patients at high or low risk of specific treatment-related adverse effects. Over the past two decades, extensive attempts have been made to understand the genetic basis of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN), one of the most severe non-haematological adverse effects of cancer treatment. Despite substantial efforts, however, the identification of a genetic profile that can detect patients at high risk of CIPN still represents an unmet need, as the information obtained from pharmacogenetic studies published so far is inconsistent at best. Among the reasons for these inconsistencies, methodological flaws and the poor reliability of existing tools for assessing CIPN features and severity are particularly relevant. This Review provides a critical update of the pharmacogenetics of CIPN, focusing on the studies published since 2011. Strategies for improving the reliability of future pharmacogenetic studies of CIPN are also discussed.},

	abstract = {目的.
为了能够评价胶质母细胞瘤(Glioblastoma, GBM)患者的预后情况,本研究分析了胶质母细胞瘤患者预后相关的临床特征,从中提取出显著相关的预后因素,依此建立一种评估胶质母细胞瘤患者预后的数学模型,以期科学、客观、有效地评价胶质母细胞瘤患者的预后状况,指导临床医生制定并优化诊疗方案,提高患者生存质量。
方法
选取2007～2011年间在中南大学湘雅医院神经外科采取手术治疗、术后病理证实为胶质母细胞瘤的119例患者资料,回顾性分析患者的临床特点、病理特点及治疗情况。采用Kaplan-Meier单因素分析筛选出预后相关因素,再通过COX生存分析对相关的单因素进行多因素分析,确定与预后相关的临床特征,根据这些临床特征的回归系数和相对危险度建立一个评价数学模型,称之为胶质母细胞瘤个体预后指数(GBM Personal Prognosis Index, GBMPI),按照计分标准将每位患者进行预后评价,研究各个危险组患者的中位生存期、生存率的差别,并用Log-Rank方法进行检验。
结果
(1)119例患者,中位年龄48岁(范围8-73岁),男女比例1.83：1,术前ECOG评分(机能状况评分)≥3分者35例(29.4\%),患者居住于城镇与乡村比例1.09：1,病灶位于单侧92.4\%,病灶累及多个脑叶(≥两个脑叶)38.6\%,肿瘤直径≤5cm占58.9\%,原发性胶质母细胞瘤90.8\%,术中快速病检与术后石蜡病检符合率为38.7\%,病灶全切82.4\%,术后接受放化疗患者69.7\%,患者中位生存时间15.4个月(95\%CI：12.8-17.9个月),1年期生存率60.5\%,2年期生存率26.8\%。
(2)经Kaplan-Meier单因素分析筛选预后相关因素为：年龄、术前ECOG评分、临床病理分型(原发性与继发性GBM); COX多因素分析后亦认为此三个因素与预后评价显著相关,根据三个因素的回归系数和相对危险度建立预后评价数学模型：胶质母细胞瘤个体预后指数(GBMPI)=年龄+ECOG评分+临床病理分型(其中年龄{\textless}60岁得0分,年龄≥60岁得1分；ECOG0/1得0分,ECOG2得2分,ECOG3/4得4分；继发性GBM得0分,原发性GBM得2分；将上述分项得分相加获得预后指数),根据预后指数确定3个风险组,分别为低危(预后指数0～2分)、中危(3-4分)和高危组(5-7分)；依据此评价模型对所有患者进行分组研究,低危、中危、高危三个组别的中位生存期依次为20.6、19.1和9.7个月,2年期生存率分别为47.4\%、32.2\%和2.4\%,经Log-Rank法进行检验,各个组别存在显著差异,有统计学意义。
结论
本研究对单中心临床数据进行分析,分别从患者的临床特点、病理特点和治疗情况三方面描述胶质母细胞瘤患者的临床特征。经统计学方法得出预后相关因素为：年龄、ECOG评分和临床病理分型,建立患者预后评价的数学模型,量化患者预后情况,为临床医生提供科学、客观、有效的参考意见,评价胶质母细胞瘤患者的病情及指导治疗。
目的
通过免疫组化技术检测GBM中EGFR、P53蛋白的表达情况,分析两者表达量及相互间关系,试图建立基于EGFR、P53的GBM分子病理诊断方法,改良GBM预后评价模型,从而客观、有效地指导GBM患者进行综合治疗和评价预后情况。
方法
应用免疫组化技术分别检测37例GBM和5例正常脑组织中EGFR、P53蛋白表达,分析其与原发性、继发性GBM分型之间的关系,使用Fisher判别模型建立GBM分子病理诊断方法,将其代替传统的临床病理诊断方法,改良GBM预后评价的数学模型。
结果
(1) EGFR蛋白在原发性GBM中表达率为65\%,P53蛋白在继发性GBM中表达率为94.1\%；EGFR(+)P53(-)大多数出现在原发性GBM中,占50\%,而EGFR(-)P53(+)多出现在继发性GBM中,占82.4\%。
(2)依据Fisher判别式建立GBM判别模型,本研究称之为GBM分子病理诊断法,即ZGBm=-1.282×EGFR+0.108×P53-0.162(其中ZGBM代表GBM判别值,Y平均为平均质心处函数值0.141,EGFR和P53为免疫组化标记指数；ZGBM小于Y平均,为原发性GBM;ZGBM大于Y平均,为继发性GBM;ZGBM等于Y平均,可判断为任意一型)。此模型经过验证组检验,其有效率为90\%。
(3)将GBM分子病理诊断法代替GBM临床诊断法,改良GBM预后评价数学模型为：GBM个体预后指数=年龄+ECOG评分+分子病理分型(其中年龄{\textless}60岁得0分,年龄≥60岁得1分；ECOG0/1得0分,ECOG2得2分,ECOG3/4得4分；ZGBM大于Y平均得0分,ZGBM小于Y平均得2分,ZGBM等于Y平均则根据具体情况判断；将上述分项得分相加获得预后指数)。
结论
EGFR、P53蛋白分别在原发性、继发性GBM中高表达；EGFR(+)P53(-)大多数出现在原发性GBM中,而EGFR(-)P53(+)多出现在继发性GBM中。根据Fisher判别模型建立的GBM分子病理诊断方法可以有效地区别原发性、继发性GBM,从而最大程度上避免GBM临床诊断法的主观性。改良后的GBM预后评价模型更加客观地指导GBM患者进行综合治疗和评价预后情况。},

	abstract = {Angiogenesis is a critical compensation route, which has been demonstrated in the brain following ischemic stroke; however, few studies have investigated angiogenesis in chronic intracranial atherosclerosis disease (ICAD). We used (68)Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 positron emission tomography/computed tomography based imaging to detect angiogenesis in chronic ICAD and to explore the factors that may have affected it. A total of 21 participants with unilateral severe chronic ICAD were included in the study. Of the 21 participants, 19 were men; the mean (SD) age was 52 (15) years. In 18 participants, we observed elevated (68)Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 uptake in the peri-infarct, subcortical, and periventricular regions of the lesioned side, with a higher (68)Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 SUVmax compared to that in the contralateral hemisphere (0.15 vs. 0.06, p=0.001). The (18)F-FDG PET SUVmax was significantly lower on the lesioned side (11.28 vs. 13.92, p=0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that the recent group ({\textless}6 months) had a higher lesion-to-contralateral region ratio SUVmax than the remote group ({\textgreater}6 months) (6.73 vs. 2.36, p{\textless}0.05). Our results provide molecular imaging evidence of angiogenesis in patients with severe chronic ICAD. Furthermore, the extent of angiogenesis in chronic ICAD may be affected by the post-qualified event time interval, and not by infarction itself or the severity of the arterial lesion.},

	abstract = {Background
Positioning a patient lying-flat in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke may improve recovery and reduce disability, but such a possibility has not been formally tested in a randomised trial. We therefore initiated the Head Position in Stroke Trial (HeadPoST) to determine the effects of lying-flat (0°) compared with sitting-up (≥30°) head positioning in the first 24 hours of hospital admission for patients with acute stroke.

Methods/Design
We plan to conduct an international, cluster randomised, crossover, open, blinded outcome-assessed clinical trial involving 140 study hospitals (clusters) with established acute stroke care programs. Each hospital will be randomly assigned to sequential policies of lying-flat (0°) or sitting-up (≥30°) head position as a ‘business as usual’ stroke care policy during the first 24 hours of admittance. Each hospital is required to recruit 60 consecutive patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS), and all patients with acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) (an estimated average of 10), in the first randomised head position policy before crossing over to the second head position policy with a similar recruitment target. After collection of in-hospital clinical and management data and 7-day outcomes, central trained blinded assessors will conduct a telephone disability assessment with the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. The primary outcome for analysis is a shift (defined as improvement) in death or disability on this scale. For a cluster size of 60 patients with AIS per intervention and with various assumptions including an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.03, a sample size of 16,800 patients at 140 centres will provide 90 \% power (α 0.05) to detect at least a 16 \% relative improvement (shift) in an ordinal logistic regression analysis of the primary outcome. The treatment effect will also be assessed in all patients with ICH who are recruited during each treatment study period.

Discussion
HeadPoST is a large international clinical trial in which we will rigorously evaluate the effects of different head positioning in patients with acute stroke.

	abstract = {The objectives of this paper are to provide an introduction to meta-analysis and to discuss the rationale for this type of research and other general considerations. Methods used to produce a rigorous meta-analysis are highlighted and some aspects of presentation and interpretation of meta-analysis are discussed., Meta-analysis is a quantitative, formal, epidemiological study design used to systematically assess previous research studies to derive conclusions about that body of research. Outcomes from a meta-analysis may include a more precise estimate of the effect of treatment or risk factor for disease, or other outcomes, than any individual study contributing to the pooled analysis. The examination of variability or heterogeneity in study results is also a critical outcome. The benefits of meta-analysis include a consolidated and quantitative review of a large, and often complex, sometimes apparently conflicting, body of literature. The specification of the outcome and hypotheses that are tested is critical to the conduct of meta-analyses, as is a sensitive literature search. A failure to identify the majority of existing studies can lead to erroneous conclusions; however, there are methods of examining data to identify the potential for studies to be missing; for example, by the use of funnel plots. Rigorously conducted meta-analyses are useful tools in evidence-based medicine. The need to integrate findings from many studies ensures that meta-analytic research is desirable and the large body of research now generated makes the conduct of this research feasible.},

We assembled an allopolyploid Brassica juncea genome by shotgun and single-molecule reads integrated to genomic and genetic maps. We discovered that the A subgenomes of B. juncea and Brassica napus each had independent origins. Results suggested that A subgenomes of B. juncea were of monophyletic origin and evolved into vegetable-use and oil-use subvarieties. Homoeolog expression dominance occurs between subgenomes of allopolyploid B. juncea, in which differentially expressed genes display more selection potential than neutral genes. Homoeolog expression dominance in B. juncea has facilitated selection of glucosinolate and lipid metabolism genes in subvarieties used as vegetables and for oil production. These homoeolog expression dominance relationships among Brassicaceae genomes have contributed to selection response, predicting the directional effects of selection in a polyploid crop genome.},

In recent years, research has focused on the pre-dementia stages of cognitive impairment in PD, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Several longitudinal studies have shown that MCI is a harbinger of dementia in PD, although the course is variable, and stabilization of cognition — or even reversal to normal cognition — is not uncommon. In addition to limbic and cortical spread of Lewy pathology, several other mechanisms are likely to contribute to cognitive decline in PD, and a variety of biomarker studies, some using novel structural and functional imaging techniques, have documented in vivo brain changes associated with cognitive impairment. The evidence consistently suggests that low cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid-β42, a marker of comorbid Alzheimer disease (AD), predict future cognitive decline and dementia in PD. Emerging genetic evidence indicates that in addition to the APOE*ε4 allele (an established risk factor for AD), GBA mutations and SCNA mutations and triplications are associated with cognitive decline in PD, whereas the findings are mixed for MAPT polymorphisms. Cognitive enhancing medications have some effect in PD dementia, but no convincing evidence that progression from MCI to dementia can be delayed or prevented is available, although cognitive training has shown promising results.},

Approaching PD as a single diagnostic entity has been effective for developing symptomatic therapies but ineffective when targeting neuroprotection or attempting disease modification. The growing number of failed attempts to establish neuroprotective therapies for PD might in part be explained by a simplistic single-target approach to drug development. Here, we argue that more attention should be paid to the symptomatic and pathological differences between patients. We propose that patients belong to distinct nodes or clusters, which are defined by clinical, pathological, genetic and molecular features of the disease. We conclude that the adoption of precision medicine in PD will require a revision of biomarker development efforts, with the ultimate goal of testing putative disease-modifying interventions in well-defined disease subgroups, as opposed to the large and heterogeneous disease populations that are typically recruited into clinical trials.},

Here, we review this literature and the evolving view of PD psychosis. Key topics include the prospective risk of dementia in individuals with PD psychosis, and the causal and modifying effects of PD medication. We discuss recent developments, including recognition of an increase in the prevalence of psychosis with disease duration, addition of new visual symptoms to the psychosis continuum, and identification of frontal executive, visual perceptual and memory dysfunction at different disease stages. In addition, we highlight novel risk factors — for example, autonomic dysfunction — that have emerged from prospective studies, structural MRI evidence of frontal, parietal, occipital and hippocampal involvement, and approval of pimavanserin for the treatment of PD psychosis. The accumulating evidence raises novel questions and directions for future research to explore the clinical management and biomarker potential of PD psychosis.},

Early PD can be divided into preclinical, prodromal and clinical stages; in this Review, we focus on the prodromal stage and markers that can be used to identify prodromal PD. We consider the necessary properties of a marker, before providing an overview of the proven and potential markers of prodromal PD, including clinical nonmotor markers, clinical motor markers, neuroimaging markers and tissue biomarkers. Markers for which the ability to predict conversion to PD is supported by the strongest evidence include olfactory loss, REM sleep behaviour disorder and constipation. Markers with the highest diagnostic strength include REM sleep behaviour disorder, dopaminergic imaging and subtle motor parkinsonism. The lead time — the period between the appearance of a marker and conversion to PD — is highly variable between markers, ranging from 5 years for impaired motor performance to {\textgreater}20 years for autonomic symptoms. The cost of screening for these markers also varies dramatically: some require just questionnaires, whereas others require sophisticated scanning techniques. Finally, we summarize how prodromal and risk markers can be combined to estimate the probability that an individual has prodromal PD, with a focus on the International Parkinson Disease and Movement Disorders Society (MDS) Prodromal Parkinson Criteria.},

	abstract = {Intracellular α-synuclein (α-syn)-rich protein aggregates called Lewy pathology (LP) and neuronal death are commonly found in the brains of patients with clinical Parkinson disease (cPD). It is widely believed that LP appears early in the disease and spreads in synaptically coupled brain networks, driving neuronal dysfunction and death. However, post-mortem analysis of human brains and connectome-mapping studies show that the pattern of LP in cPD is not consistent with this simple model, arguing that, if LP propagates in cPD, it must be gated by cell- or region-autonomous mechanisms. Moreover, the correlation between LP and neuronal death is weak. In this Review, we briefly discuss the evidence for and against the spreading LP model, as well as evidence that cell-autonomous factors govern both α-syn pathology and neuronal death.},

These non-motor features appear across the spectrum of patients with PD, including individuals with genetic causes of PD. The neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological bases of non-motor abnormalities in PD remain largely undefined. Here, we discuss recent advances that have helped to establish the presence, severity and effect on the quality of life of non-motor symptoms in PD, and the neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological mechanisms involved. We also discuss the potential for the non-motor features to define a prodrome that may enable the early diagnosis of PD.},

Computers have now mastered a popular variant of poker, learned the laws of physics from experimental data, and become experts in video games − tasks that would have been deemed impossible not too long ago. In parallel, the number of companies centered on applying complex data analysis to varying industries has exploded, and it is thus unsurprising that some analytic companies are turning attention to problems in health care. The purpose of this review is to explore what problems in medicine might benefit from such learning approaches and use examples from the literature to introduce basic concepts in machine learning. It is important to note that seemingly large enough medical data sets and adequate learning algorithms have been available for many decades, and yet, although there are thousands of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries. Thus, part of my effort will be to identify what obstacles there may be to changing the practice of medicine through statistical learning approaches, and discuss how these might be overcome.},

Seventy-four patients at onset of CIS were scanned and clinically reviewed after one and three years. CDMS was used as the gold standard against which SVM classification accuracy was tested. Radiological features related to lesional characteristics on conventional MRI were defined a priori and used in combination with clinical/demographic features in an SVM. Forward recursive feature elimination with 100 bootstraps and a leave-one-out cross-validation was used to find the most predictive feature combinations. 30 \% and 44 \% of patients developed CDMS within one and three years, respectively. The SVMs correctly predicted the presence (or the absence) of CDMS in 71.4 \% of patients (sensitivity/specificity: 77 \%/66 \%) at 1 year, and in 68 \% (60 \%/76 \%) at 3 years on average over all bootstraps. Combinations of features consistently gave a higher accuracy in predicting outcome than any single feature. Machine-learning-based classifications can be used to provide an "individualised" prediction of conversion to MS from subjects' baseline scans and clinical characteristics, with potential to be incorporated into routine clinical practice.},

Survival models relate the time that passes before some event occurs to one or more covariates that may be associated with that quantity of time. In a proportional hazards model, the unique effect of a unit increase in a covariate is multiplicative with respect to the hazard rate. For example, taking a drug may halve one's hazard rate for a stroke occurring, or, changing the material from which a manufactured component is constructed may double its hazard rate for failure. Other types of survival models such as accelerated failure time models do not exhibit proportional hazards. The accelerated failure time model describes a situation where the biological or mechanical life history of an event is accelerated.},

AIC is founded on information theory: it offers a relative estimate of the information lost when a given model is used to represent the process that generates the data. In doing so, it deals with the trade-off between the goodness of fit of the model and the complexity of the model.
AIC does not provide a test of a model in the sense of testing a null hypothesis, so it can tell nothing about the quality of the model in an absolute sense. If all the candidate models fit poorly, AIC will not give any warning of that.},

We connect the accuracy summaries to a previously proposed global concordance measure, which is a variant of Kendall's tau. In addition, we show how standard Cox regression output can be used to obtain estimates of time-dependent sensitivity and specificity, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Semiparametric estimation methods appropriate for both proportional and nonproportional hazards data are introduced, evaluated in simulations, and illustrated using two familiar survival data sets.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine the association of Joint National Committee (JNC-V) blood pressure and National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) cholesterol categories with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, to incorporate them into coronary prediction algorithms, and to compare the discrimination properties of this approach with other noncategorical prediction functions.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This work was designed as a prospective, single-center study in the setting of a community-based cohort. The patients were 2489 men and 2856 women 30 to 74 years old at baseline with 12 years of follow-up. During the 12 years of follow-up, a total of 383 men and 227 women developed CHD, which was significantly associated with categories of blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (all P{\textless}.001). Sex-specific prediction equations were formulated to predict CHD risk according to age, diabetes, smoking, JNC-V blood pressure categories, and NCEP total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol categories. The accuracy of this categorical approach was found to be comparable to CHD prediction when the continuous variables themselves were used. After adjustment for other factors, approximately 28\% of CHD events in men and 29\% in women were attributable to blood pressure levels that exceeded high normal ({\textgreater} or =130/85). The corresponding multivariable-adjusted attributable risk percent associated with elevated total cholesterol ({\textgreater} or =200 mg/dL) was 27\% in men and 34\% in women.
CONCLUSIONS: Recommended guidelines of blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol effectively predict CHD risk in a middle-aged white population sample. A simple coronary disease prediction algorithm was developed using categorical variables, which allows physicians to predict multivariate CHD risk in patients without overt CHD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circos is a Perl language based software package for visualizing similarities and differences of genome structure and positional relationships between genomic intervals. Running Circos requires extra data processing procedures to prepare plot data files and configure files from datasets, which limits its capability of integrating directly with other software tools such as R. Recently published R Bioconductor package ggbio provides a function to display genomic data in circular layout based on multiple other packages, which increases its complexity of usage and decreased the flexibility in integrating with other R pipelines.
RESULTS: We implemented an R package, RCircos, using only R packages that come with R base installation. The package supports Circos 2D data track plots such as scatter, line, histogram, heatmap, tile, connectors, links, and text labels. Each plot is implemented with a specific function and input data for all functions are data frames which can be objects read from text files or generated with other R pipelines.
CONCLUSION: RCircos package provides a simple and flexible way to make Circos 2D track plots with R and could be easily integrated into other R data processing and graphic manipulation pipelines for presenting large-scale multi-sample genomic research data. It can also serve as a base tool to generate complex Circos images.},

The replication population comprised 1132 patients (further excluding 14 patients with missing covariates) from three longitudinal cohorts with 19 127 follow-up visits over 8·6 years (median 6·5, IQR 4·1–7·2). The cognitive risk score predicted cognitive impairment within 10 years of disease onset with an area under the curve (AUC) of more than 0·85 in both the discovery (95\% CI 0·82–0·90) and replication (95\% CI 0·78–0·91) populations. Patients scoring in the highest quartile for cognitive risk score had an increased hazard for global cognitive impairment compared with those in the lowest quartile (hazard ratio 18·4 [95\% CI 9·4–36·1]). Dementia or disabling cognitive impairment was predicted with an AUC of 0·88 (95\% CI 0·79–0·94) and a negative predictive value of 0·92 (95\% 0·88–0·95) at the predefined cutoff of 0·196.

本研究的灵感来源：
通过Pubmed文献检索，收集分析各种单因素认知功能风险预测的文单，找到合适的预测因子。另外，预测10年CHD风险有Framingham风险评分量表，咱们帕金森也应该有一个。
本研究开发的量表最大用处就是用于临床实验，以后这方面的控制就可以量化了。现在该量表有了beta测试版在线计算器。
讨论：
纵向队列设计比静止的传统设计优越。
各队列的纳入标准不同。尽管不能代表帕金森的整体人群特征，但和典型的美国临床试验很像。本量表在各个队列中都有效，恰证明了它的稳定性。它应该可以用于其他类似的队列，或以后的试验样本。
为临床实验设计，未具备临床日常诊疗应用的条件。需要做前瞻性研究，还要有神经心理学方面的支持。

每个队列都有Hoehn-Yahr分级
discovery population用于评估候选的临床及GBA风险因子，建立一个跟Framingham在统计学上相似的预测评分量表。选了9个临床变量，选GBA是因为它含义明确，其他位点的研究还没清楚就不选了。评价每个单一变量的供献率？权重？
【方法】
第一步：在discovery集中，用Cox比例风险模型评估9个候选因素与时间的关系（从帕金森发病到整体认知功能损伤的时长（年））相关系数？？？\#￥！345@\#￥@\#￥??除UPDRS II外其余都很好。比例风险模型在8个因子中有效。8个进入多变量Cox模型。据Akaike信息标准，后向排除法除去不提供信息的变量。于是排险了Hoehn-Yahr分级。所以最后的多变量Cox回归模型包含了剩下的七个风险因素。为了校正7个队列的异质性，加入了队列变量（？），用frailty Cox模型。第二步：然后在1132人中得到了验证。Chchran Q检验和I2指数检测队列间异质性。第三步：为了测试模型的稳定性，从整个研究样本中通过重复取样的方法随机生成10000个验证和测试集（？？1万个集还是1万个样本？）每次迭代，都在训练集的开始重建预测评分，用Akaike排除无效变量，并在相应的测试集中预测认知损伤。第四步：在replication集中……用病程校正后的Meta分析，评估评分高（{\textgreater}0.196）和低（{\textless}=0.196）者的MMSE和MoCA变化轨迹……？
【结果】
排除了XXX人，6个队列划分为discovery集，1350人（在排完MMSE和12年的基础上，又排除了协变量不完整的334人）
【故事框架】
第一步：建立模型用模型计算整体的认知风险评分比例变异（Propotional variance？）是97.4\%。7个因子每个都对量表有显著信息贡献（contributed to the information content of the score）。Cox计算贡献率？发病年龄贡献了那个variance的56.5\%，然后是MMSE（7.7\%）、受教育年限（5.4\%），入组时的UPDRS-III评分（4.7\%），性别（2.6\%），入组时的抑郁状态（1.9\%），GBA突变（1.5\%）——听着好像PCA啊。Appendix提供了这7个预测子经协变量校正后的discovery集的生存曲线。用认知风险评分来预测患者发病10年内是否会出现整体认知功能损伤，有很高的准确率。AUC=0.86，最佳临界点为0.196，特异性0.72，敏感性0.87。第四分位比最低分位的风险比增高，KM曲线示，10年后，处在最低四分位的患者有95\%能不发生认知损伤，而最高四分位距者只有34.9\%能幸免。第二步：验证模型的预测效力由7个因子和beta相关系数组成的评分先locked-in，然后用于新的样本用于预测（replication集），严格应用（？？）四分位距和最佳临界点。AUC=0.85，在0.196的临界点上，特异性0.74，敏感性0.73。非痴呆帕金森患者中，中度认知障碍的患病率为26.7\%，以此校正之后，NPV为0.88，PPV为0.51。四分位距情况相似（table2）。最低四分位距者，96.3\%幸免，最高者27.4\%幸免。见KM曲线。用来预测10年内痴呆的AUC比预测整体认知损伤还要高一些。在0.196的点上，敏感性0.86，特异性0.72。上下四分位的HR相差21.9。上四分位的48.3\%幸免于痴呆，下四分位只有98.9\%幸免。第三步：检验模型的稳定性机器选择变量重建模型（？）10000次迭代，逐步式剪枝(stepwise pruning）后，发病年龄、入组时的MMSE、受教育时长在所有迭代中都留下了；入组时的MDS-UPDRS III在98.30\%的迭代中留下，GBC突变有91.79\%，抑郁状有识之士90.61\%，性别78.52\%。（figure 4A）。原来没用来建模的Hoehn-Yahr分级，则在34.86\%的迭代中加入了模型。在这10000次重复采样的检测中，平均AUC为0.83，对痴呆的预测还更高，有0.87，与之前的稳定变量筛选、评分预测性能相一致。此外在10000次重复取样的训练集和验证集中对痴呆也的预测也准确而稳定。（figure 4B）。应用：先简单验证一下：入组时预测评分高者，后来的MMSE降得越快。MoCA也是。（figure 5）假设将这个评分用于一个3年的临床试验，研究某种药物延缓认知障碍（以MMSE或MoCA来量化）。如果以评分来控制入组标准，要达到同样的统计功效，则其需要的样本量会比不使用该评分控制基线时缩小六倍，大大节省了科研资源。MoCA的敏感性比MMSE高一些，用MoCA量化时，干预组和对照组各137人就可以达到80\%的统计功效，而MMSE则需要各组152人。如果不加控制，假设有同样的alpha(一类错误)，同样的标准差，同样的test-retest关系，则则需要每组801/802人。（figure 5C）善后：又做了纵向的稳定性与表现分析，在各种时间框架下（1年{\textasciitilde}11年）都很稳定，不过12年后就衰弱了，可能是因为很少患者能依从完整的12年随访吧（数据量少？）。认知评价即有二分变量指标（整体认知损伤、1级痴呆），也有连续变量指标（MMSE和MoCA）。最后，为不便检测GBA的地方开发了一个只有6个临床特征的版本。同样在发现集和重复集中都有很好的准确性，AUC分别为0.86和0.83。只不对在head to head比较中，单临床版本显著没那么好。p{\textless}0.0001。}

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}BACKGROUND{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the most common human neurodegenerative diseases. AD is primarily a dementing disease, and PD is a movement disorder. Together, they affect around 50 million people worldwide, with the vast majority of disease cases being sporadic. Their incidence increases with age. Like most neurodegenerative diseases, AD and PD are caused by the aggregation of a small number of proteins, with filament assemblies constituting the end-point of protein aggregation. AD is characterized by the presence of abundant extracellular plaques made of amyloid assemblies of Aβ peptides and intraneuronal inclusions made of assembled tau protein. Some dominantly inherited cases of AD are caused by mutations in the gene encoding the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the cleavage of which gives rise to Aβ. In these cases, dysfunction of APP precedes dysfunction of tau. In contrast, mutations in \textit{MAPT}, the tau gene, give rise to dominantly inherited frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism, with abundant tau inclusions in the absence of Aβ plaques. Extrapolation to the much more common sporadic cases of AD has given rise to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which postulates that Aβ aggregation causes the formation of tau inclusions, synaptic dysfunction, nerve cell death, and brain shrinkage. However, tau inclusions correlate better with cognitive impairment, and Aβ may exert its effects through tau. Strategies targeting the formation of Aβ and tau assemblies are valuable for the development of mechanism-based therapies. Unlike AD, in which two distinct amyloid assemblies are present, PD is characterized by intracellular deposits, Lewy bodies and neurites, both composed of the protein α-synuclein. Dominantly inherited forms of PD are caused by mutations in \textit{SNCA}, the α-synuclein gene. More than 95\% of those diagnosed with PD have Lewy inclusions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}ADVANCES{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}For many years, the mechanisms underlying AD and PD were widely believed to be cell-autonomous. This implies that the same molecular events, such as the formation of tau and α-synuclein assemblies, occur independently in a large number of cells in an otherwise healthy brain. Recent findings have suggested instead that non–cell-autonomous processes play an important part in AD and PD. Inclusions are thought to form in a small number of cells and—given enough time and, perhaps, a genetic predisposition—spread in a deterministic manner to distant brain regions. The formation of the first Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein inclusions is probably stochastic, with most seeds being degraded. Distinct molecular conformers of aggregated proteins (or strains) may underlie clinically different diseases. This is reminiscent of human prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). However, there is reluctance to use the term prion for the inclusions of AD and PD. The main reasons are that in contrast to Kuru and CJD, transmission of AD and PD has not been demonstrated between individuals, and most experimental studies have used transgenic animals that overexpress disease proteins.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}OUTLOOK{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The prion concept appears to apply to all human neurodegenerative diseases with abnormal protein assemblies, including AD and PD. This has brought unity to the field and changed the way we think about these diseases. It has been known for some time that a seed can template aggregation of the homologous protein. However, the ability of protein aggregates to spread through the nervous system had previously been underappreciated. At a practical level, the new findings are helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying disease, which may have therapeutic implications in all cases. It will be important to identify the molecular species of assembled host proteins responsible for propagation and neurotoxicity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}, {\textless}p{\textgreater}The pathological assembly of Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein is at the heart of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Extracellular deposits of Aβ and intraneuronal tau inclusions define Alzheimer’s disease, whereas intracellular inclusions of α-synuclein make up the Lewy pathology of Parkinson’s disease. Most cases of disease are sporadic, but some are inherited in a dominant manner. Mutations frequently occur in the genes encoding Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein. Overexpression of these mutant proteins can give rise to disease-associated phenotypes. Protein assembly begins in specific regions of the brain during the process of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, from where it spreads to other areas.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}, {\textless}h3{\textgreater}Converging paradigms in neurodegeneration{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Parkinson9s disease and Alzheimer9s disease are progressive neurodegenerative diseases with increasing prevalence in our aging populations. Recent evidence suggests that some of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathology of these diseases have similarities to those observed in infectious prion diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease). Goedert reviews how the spread of a variety of pathological protein aggregates is involved in neurodegenerative disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}\textit{Science}, this issue p. 10.1126/science.1255555{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

《论震颤麻痹》的成书时间，正处在医学思想的转型期。18世纪，疾病分类的主要方法是症状学，以观察到的临床表现区分，而病因则很少得到关注，也很难深入调查。Morgagni（1761）发现，疾病的临床表现与尸检发现的病理改变有关，这才渐渐引发了改革，直到1800年巴黎学派才开始运用临床解剖学的方法来分类疾病。自此以后，病理学才成为疾病分类的金标准。[[有人说Parkinson的兴趣伸向各个领域，其实也是由于处于启蒙运动大时代下，思想解放，许多人的思想都开始各处蹦哒。]]他的描述虽然参考了正在发展的临床病理学，但其实还是从症状学出发。这也提示，神经病学的发端，是从简明准确的临床描述及分类开始的（谁不是=\_=）。尽管结构复杂的句式和频繁断句的古英文读起来有点硌牙，但写得很详细准确，使现代的读者读来仍能在脑海中构建出患者的形象，对疾病能有清晰的认识。写作风格甚至还受到当时普通文学的影响。仅表达自己的观点过感觉，经常将自己置于读者的视角，避免沉重的正式文案，常常短小精悍。尽管Parkinson这篇相当长，还分章节，看起来像本书，但也还是有散文的影子。叙述为主，看起来像小说，所以有画面感吧。当时就有人注意到这篇文章并引用，但没有人能超越他的观察，也没有流传到海外。直到40年后的Trousseau和Charcot。直到19世纪后期，它才被描述成我们现在认识的样子。}

不知道在哪里接受的教育，但1784年，他的名字突然出现在伦敦法团认证的一份外科医生名单上。简直是石缝里蹦出来的外科医生。1783年结婚，婚后就继承了父亲在Hoxton广场的小诊所。
1785年参加了John Hunter的一个演讲，用速记法记下来再整理，1833年由儿子JWK Parkinson出版，题名叫《Hunterian Reminiscences》。
1780年匿名发表Obervations on Dr. Smith's Philosophy of Physic, a critical appraisal of Smith's theories. With the exception of a brief account of the effects of lightning(1789)。直到19世纪末，他的政治和社会活动渐渐减少之前，他都没发表什么科学著作。不过在此期间，他的临床业务却一直欣欣向荣，并且在这个期间，他又对地理学和古生物学发生了兴趣。
下层社会人士和法国大革命的支持者，争取普选权，要求下议院代表人民并每年改选。
他早年的事业和生活，满满的都是各种社会活动及革命。他还用“Old Hubert”（老胡伯？）的笔名发表了许多时评小杂文。
支持下议院人民代表改革？？？
他还参加了好几个地下政治团体，包括London Corresponding Society for Reform of Parliamentary Representation（伦敦通讯协会伦敦通讯协会）。1794年，这个协会密谋刺杀英王佐治三世，史称“玩具枪行动”。当年10月，检举参与国王刺杀行动？
【不为良相便为良医】
1799年到1807年间，他发表了许多小型医学著作，似乎兴致盎然。包括1805年一篇关于病风的，还有1812年的一个报告，记录了腹膜炎伴穿孔性阑尾坏疽。后者可能是英语医学文献中关于此病症的最早记录。
1799年发表了《医学忠告》，这是他的医学科普系列中的第一本。这个系列也是致力于改善共公卫生状况，提高普通市井民众的健康素质（真是又红又专）。也是跟他的政治理想一脉相承。
1811年，他的博爱人道主义又冒泡了，他提议疯人院要规范管理，给予更好的安全保卫，并给精神病患者及其监护人、医生、家庭提供法律保护。
最重要的医学著作是1817年的An Essay on the Shaking Palsy。他这样描述震颤麻痹：“非自主震颤性运动，肌力下降（？），有时即便给予支持也不能活动（？）。躯干有前屈的倾向，行走时会渐渐转变成小跑的步率。感觉和智力不受损。”
虽然从现代医学来看的确朴拙了一点，但却是从众多的震颤性神经系统疾病中，将其分离出来作为一个可以独立诊断的临床疾病。
40年后，Charcot等人才补充了运动徐缓、刻板、叠加综合征等描述，将本病以他命名，改称为帕金森病。
1812年，Parkinson协助儿子（外科医生），描述了英文医学史上的第一例阑尾炎，也是第一次穿孔作为死因的实例描述。
【良医又变成了自然科学家】
18世纪末，他开始收集各种标本，画化石，附在他的《化学口袋书》第2版的后面，这是一本给学生和外行科普读物，里面反映了他的兴趣泛及医学、地理、化石等。他喜欢和孩子们来点短途旅行，去观察或收集动植物化石。他想再深入了解这些化石，却发现英文著作中对它们的阐释基本是空的，于是他又决定写书，自己动手丰衣足食！
1804年出版了《Organic Remains of the Former World》（史前世界的有机物遗迹）。到了1850年，Gideon Mantell说它是“第一次尝试用插图给化石一个亲民又科学的描述，是不列颠古生物学史上很有纪念意义的事件”。
第二第三册分别于1808年和1811年出版，那时他也还在Hoxton广场1号行医。在本领域中，他最重要的著作是1822年出版的一本小型著作《Elements of Oryctology（化石学基础）》。
那个《有机物遗迹》配有许多插图，有些还是彩图，都是他自己画的。这些图后来在Gideon mantell的《化石遗迹图谱》（1850）中再次出版。这在英国的古生物学界是很大的贡献。
【还是没能逃出神学框架】
尽管学习、观察、研究、发现了这么多，但他还是坚决反对任何关于自然进化的理论。他认为所有的演化都是跟据圣经的剧本进行，当原始的岩石被创造出来后，就出现了植物，然后是水生动物、空气中的动物（什么鬼？飞行？细菌？），再后来便有了陆生动物，然后是人类。在某些场合下，他还特别强调圣经中记载的大洪水，还说创造和灭绝是一个持续进行的过程，但都有幕后的大导演。圣经说的创世时的“1天”，其实代表一个很长的地质年代。
 

尽管帕金森病家喻户晓，但在Parkinson的英国本土文化圈中，他本人却鲜为人知，直到1912年，美国人J. G. Rowntree在约翰霍普金斯医院公报上写了一篇文章，题为“英国土生土长，却被英国遗忘，这就是James Parkinson的命运。”
1824年12月21日在Kingsland路逝世。儿子J. W. K. Parkinson继续在Hoxton广场行医，后来又去了伦敦附近的Islington。他是英格兰皇家外科医学学成员。

他参加那个伦敦通讯协会，当时有可能不经审讯直接关押的。
气枪案是政府陷害，5人被捕，要求Parkinson作证，并强迫他承认自己就是老胡伯。他一直拒绝，直到确信举证之后自己可无罪行释放。他果然被放了，但他其他的小伙伴确在无罪释放之前糟受了很久的牢狱之苦。（后半段来自Wiki）。
经此一役，又加上公开演讲受限越来越多，他的精力才转回医学上来，主要关注公共和精神健康。这才有了后来的发现。}

	abstract = {The decision curve is a graphical summary recently proposed for assessing the potential clinical impact of risk prediction biomarkers or risk models for recommending treatment or intervention. It was applied recently in an article in Journal of Clinical Oncology to measure the impact of using a genomic risk model for deciding on adjuvant radiation therapy for prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. We illustrate the use of decision curves for evaluating clinical- and biomarker-based models for predicting a man's risk of prostate cancer, which could be used to guide the decision to biopsy. Decision curves are grounded in a decision-theoretical framework that accounts for both the benefits of intervention and the costs of intervention to a patient who cannot benefit. Decision curves are thus an improvement over purely mathematical measures of performance such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. However, there are challenges in using and interpreting decision curves appropriately. We caution that decision curves cannot be used to identify the optimal risk threshold for recommending intervention. We discuss the use of decision curves for miscalibrated risk models. Finally, we emphasize that a decision curve shows the performance of a risk model in a population in which every patient has the same expected benefit and cost of intervention. If every patient has a personal benefit and cost, then the curves are not useful. If subpopulations have different benefits and costs, subpopulation-specific decision curves should be used. As a companion to this article, we released an R software package called DecisionCurve for making decision curves and related graphics.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diagnostic and prognostic models are typically evaluated with measures of accuracy that do not address clinical consequences. Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but often require collection of additional information and may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result. The authors sought a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences,requires only the data set on which the models are tested,and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results.
METHOD: The authors describe decision curve analysis, a simple, novel method of evaluating predictive models. They start by assuming that the threshold probability of a disease or event at which a patient would opt for treatment is informative of how the patient weighs the relative harms of a false-positive and a false-negative prediction. This theoretical relationship is then used to derive the net benefit of the model across different threshold probabilities. Plotting net benefit against threshold probability yields the "decision curve." The authors apply the method to models for the prediction of seminal vesicle invasion in prostate cancer patients. Decision curve analysis identified the range of threshold probabilities in which a model was of value, the magnitude of benefit, and which of several models was optimal.
CONCLUSION: Decision curve analysis is a suitable method for evaluating alternative diagnostic and prognostic strategies that has advantages over other commonly used measures and techniques.},

In the mid-1800s, Jean-Martin Charcot was particularly influential in refining and expanding this early description and in disseminating information internationally about Parkinson's disease. He separated Parkinson's disease from multiple sclerosis and other disorders characterized by tremor, and he recognized cases that later would likely be classified among the Parkinsonism-plus syndromes. Early treatments of Parkinson's disease were based on empirical observation, and anticholinergic drugs were used as early as the nineteenth century. The discovery of dopaminergic deficits in Parkinson's disease and the synthetic pathway of dopamine led to the first human trials of levodopa. Further historically important anatomical, biochemical, and physiological studies identified additional pharmacological and neurosurgical targets for Parkinson's disease and allow modern clinicians to offer an array of therapies aimed at improving function in this still incurable disease., Since Parkinson’s disease was first described in 1817, rational treatments have evolved based on anatomical, biochemical, and physiological studies. For example, the discovery of dopaminergic deficits led to the use of levodopa.},

	abstract = {Exosome secretion is a notable feature of malignancy owing to the roles of these nanoparticles in cancer growth, immune suppression, tumor angiogenesis and therapeutic resistance. Exosomes are 30-100 nm membrane vesicles released by many cells types during normal physiological processes. Tumors aberrantly secrete large quantities of exosomes that transport oncoproteins and immune suppressive molecules to support tumor growth and metastasis. The role of exosomes in intercellular signaling is exemplified by human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) over-expressing breast cancer, where exosomes with the HER2 oncoprotein stimulate tumor growth and interfere with the activity of the therapeutic antibody Herceptin®. Since numerous observations from experimental model systems point toward an important clinical impact of exosomes in cancer, several pharmacological strategies have been proposed for targeting their malignant activities. We also propose a novel device strategy involving extracorporeal hemofiltration of exosomes from the entire circulatory system using an affinity plasmapheresis platform known as the Aethlon ADAPT™ (adaptive dialysis-like affinity platform technology) system, which would overcome the risks of toxicity and drug interactions posed by pharmacological approaches. This technology allows affinity agents, including exosome-binding lectins and antibodies, to be immobilized in the outer-capillary space of plasma filtration membranes that integrate into existing kidney dialysis systems. Device therapies that evolve from this platform allow rapid extracorporeal capture and selective retention of target particles {\textless} 200 nm from the entire circulatory system. This strategy is supported by clinical experience in hepatitis C virus-infected patients using an ADAPT™ device, the Hemopurifier®, to reduce the systemic load of virions having similar sizes and glycosylated surfaces as cancer exosomes. This review discusses the possible therapeutic approaches for targeting immune suppressive exosomes in cancer patients, and the anticipated significance of these strategies for reversing immune dysfunction and improving responses to standard of care treatments.},

GPC1(+) circulating exosomes (crExos) were monitored and isolated using flow cytometry from the serum of patients and mice with cancer. GPC1(+) crExos were detected in the serum of patients with pancreatic cancer with absolute specificity and sensitivity, distinguishing healthy subjects and patients with a benign pancreatic disease from patients with early- and late-stage pancreatic cancer. Levels of GPC1(+) crExos correlate with tumour burden and the survival of pre- and post-surgical patients. GPC1(+) crExos from patients and from mice with spontaneous pancreatic tumours carry specific KRAS mutations, and reliably detect pancreatic intraepithelial lesions in mice despite negative signals by magnetic resonance imaging.

We hypothesized that intercellular communication is critical for metastatic progression. Here, we show that PDAC-derived exosomes induce liver pre-metastatic niche formation in naive mice and consequently increase liver metastatic burden. Uptake of PDAC-derived exosomes by Kupffer cells caused transforming growth factor β secretion and upregulation of fibronectin production by hepatic stellate cells. This fibrotic microenvironment enhanced recruitment of bone marrow-derived macrophages. We found that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was highly expressed in PDAC-derived exosomes, and its blockade prevented liver pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis. Compared with patients whose pancreatic tumours did not progress, MIF was markedly higher in exosomes from stage I PDAC patients who later developed liver metastasis. These findings suggest that exosomal MIF primes the liver for metastasis and may be a prognostic marker for the development of PDAC liver metastasis.},

Furthermore, bioactive lncARSR could be incorporated into exosomes and transmitted to sensitive cells, thus disseminating sunitinib resistance. Treatment of sunitinib-resistant RCC with locked nucleic acids targeting lncARSR or an AXL/c-MET inhibitor restored sunitinib response.

Tumor-secreted miR-214 was sufficiently delivered into recipient T cells by microvesicles (MVs). In targeted mouse peripheral CD4+ T cells, tumor-derived miR-214 efficiently downregulated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and promoted Treg expansion. The miR-214-induced Tregs secreted higher levels of IL-10 and promoted tumor growth in nude mice. Furthermore, in vivo studies indicated that Treg expansion mediated by cancer cell-secreted miR-214 resulted in enhanced immune suppression and tumor implantation/growth in mice. The MV delivery of anti-miR-214 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) into mice implanted with tumors blocked Treg expansion and tumor growth.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regulatory T cells (Treg) and tumor-exosomes are thought to play a role in preventing the rejection of malignant cells in patients bearing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
METHODS: Treg recruitment by exosomes derived from NPC cell lines (C15/C17-Exo), exosomes isolated from NPC patients' plasma (Patient-Exo), and CCL20 were tested in vitro using Boyden chamber assays and in vivo using a xenograft SCID mouse model (n = 5), both in the presence and absence of anti-CCL20 monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Impact of these NPC exosomes (NPC-Exo) on Treg phenotype and function was determined using adapted assays (FACS, Q-PCR, ELISA, and MLR). Experiments were performed in comparison with exosomes derived from plasma of healthy donors (HD-Exo). The Student's t test was used for group comparisons. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: CCL20 allowed the intratumoral recruitment of human Treg. NPC-Exo also facilitated Treg recruitment (3.30 ± 0.34 fold increase, P {\textless} .001), which was statistically significantly inhibited (P {\textless} .001) by an anti-CCL20 blocking mAb. NPC-Exo also recruited conventional CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells and mediated their conversion into inhibitory CD4(+)CD25(high) cells. Moreover, NPC-Exo enhanced (P = .0048) the expansion of human Treg, inducing the generation of Tim3(Low) Treg with increased expression of CD25 and FOXP3. Finally, NPC-Exo induced an overexpression of cell markers associated with Treg phenotype, properties and recruitment capacity. For example, GZMB mean fold change was 21.45 ± 1.75 (P {\textless} .001). These results were consistent with a stronger suppression of responder cells' proliferation and the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL10, TGFB1).
CONCLUSION: Interactions between NPC-Exo and Treg represent a newly defined mechanism that may be involved in regulating peripheral tolerance by tumors and in supporting immune evasion in human NPC.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tumor-derived microvesicles (TMV) or exosomes are present in body fluids of patients with cancer and might be involved in tumor progression. The frequency and suppressor functions of peripheral blood CD4(+)CD25(high)FOXP3(+) Treg are higher in patients with cancer than normal controls. The hypothesis is tested that TMV contribute to induction/expansion/and activation of human Treg.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: TMV isolated from supernatants of tumor cells but not normal cells induced the generation and enhanced expansion of human Treg. TMV also mediated conversion of CD4(+)CD25(neg) T cells into CD4(+)CD25(high)FOXP3(+) Treg. Upon co-incubation with TMV, Treg showed an increased FasL, IL-10, TGF-beta1, CTLA-4, granzyme B and perforin expression (p{\textless}0.05) and mediated stronger suppression of responder cell (RC) proliferation (p{\textless}0.01). Purified Treg were resistant to TMV-mediated apoptosis relative to other T cells. TMV also increased phospho-SMAD2/3 and phospho-STAT3 expression in Treg. Neutralizing Abs specific for TGF-beta1 and/or IL-10 significantly inhibited TMV ability to expand Treg.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study suggests that TMV have immunoregulatory properties. They induce Treg, promote Treg expansion, up-regulate Treg suppressor function and enhance Treg resistance to apoptosis. Interactions of TMV with Treg represent a newly-defined mechanism that might be involved in regulating peripheral tolerance by tumors and in supporting immune evasion of human cancers.},

	abstract = {Human tumors constitutively release endosome-derived microvesicles, transporting a broad array of biologically active molecules with potential modulatory effects on different immune cells. Here, we report the first evidence that tumor-released microvesicles alter myeloid cell function by impairing monocyte differentiation into dendritic cells and promoting the generation of a myeloid immunosuppressive cell subset. CD14+ monocytes isolated from healthy donors and differentiated with interleukin (IL)-4 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the presence of tumor-derived microvesicles turned into HLA-DR(-/low) cells, retaining CD14 expression and failing to up-regulate costimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86. These phenotypic changes were paralleled by a significant release of different cytokines, including IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and a dose-dependent suppressive activity on activated T-cell-proliferation and cytolytic functions, which could be reversed by anti-TGF-beta-neutralizing antibodies. Microvesicles isolated from plasma of advanced melanoma patients, but not from healthy donors, mediated comparable effects on CD14+ monocytes, skewing their differentiation toward CD14+HLA-DR-/low cells with TGF-beta-mediated suppressive activity on T-cell-functions. Interestingly, a subset of TGF-beta-secreting CD14+HLA-DR- cells mediating suppressive activity on T lymphocytes was found to be significantly expanded in peripheral blood of melanoma patients compared with healthy donors. These data suggest the development in cancer patients of an immunosuppressive circuit by which tumors promote the generation of suppressive myeloid cells through the release of circulating microvesicles and without the need for cell-to-cell contact. Therapeutic interventions on the crucial steps of this pathway may contribute to restore tumor/immune system interactions favoring T-cell-mediated control of tumor growth in cancer patients.},

	abstract = {The hypothesis that FasL expression by tumor cells may impair the in vivo efficacy of antitumor immune responses, through a mechanism known as ‘Fas tumor counterattack,’ has been recently questioned, becoming the object of an intense debate based on conflicting results. Here we definitely show that FasL is indeed detectable in the cytoplasm of melanoma cells and its expression is confined to multivesicular bodies that contain melanosomes. In these structures FasL colocalizes with both melanosomal (i.e., gp100) and lysosomal (i.e., CD63) antigens. Isolated melanosomes express FasL, as detected by Western blot and cytofluorimetry, and they can exert Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells. We additionally show that melanosome-containing multivesicular bodies degranulate extracellularly and release FasL-bearing microvesicles, that coexpress both gp100 and CD63 and retain their functional activity in triggering Fas-dependent apoptosis of lymphoid cells. Hence our data provide evidence for a novel mechanism potentially operating in Fas tumor counterattack through the secretion of subcellular particles expressing functional FasL. Such vesicles may form a sort of front line hindering lymphocytes and other immunocompetent cells from entering neoplastic lesions and exert their antitumor activity.},

Through an interaction with a range of host tissues, exosomes are able to generate a pro-tumor environment that is essential for carcinogenesis.

We hypothesized that if aberrantly expressing microRNAs (miRNA) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues are detected in blood plasma, then plasma profiling of these miRNAs might serve as a minimally invasive early detection biomarker assay for this malignancy. By using a modified protocol to isolate and quantify plasma miRNAs from heparin-treated blood, we show that miRNA profiling in plasma can differentiate pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients from healthy controls. We have profiled four miRNAs, miR-21, miR-210, miR-155, and miR-196a, all implicated in the development of pancreatic cancer with either proven or predicted target genes involved in critical cancer-associated cellular pathways. Of these, miR-155 has recently been identified as a candidate biomarker of early pancreatic neoplasia, whereas elevated expression of miR196a has been shown to parallel progression of disease. The results revealed a sensitivity of 64\% and a specificity of 89\% with the analyses of plasma levels for this panel of four miRNAs. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were estimated at 0.82 and 0.78 without and with leave-one-out cross-validation scheme, respectively. These observations, although a “proof of principle” finding at this time, show the feasibility of developing plasma miRNA profiling as a sensitive and specific blood-based biomarker assay for pancreatic cancer that has the potential of translation to the clinic with additional improvements in the future.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) is the most lethal gastrointestinal (GI) tumor. Although many studies on differentially expressed miRNAs as candidate biomarkers of pancreatic cancer have been published, reliability of these findings generated from investigations performed in single laboratory settings remain unclear.
RESULTS: There were 29 articles with a total of 2,225 patients and 1,618 controls included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity was 82\% (95\% CI, 79-85\%); the specificity was 85\% (95\% CI, 79-89\%); and area under the curve (AUC) was 0.89 (95\% CI, 0.86-0.92). Subgroup analyses indicated that there were significant divergences between Caucasian and Asian subgroups for circulating miRNA analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To comprehensively investigate the potential utility of miRNAs as biomarkers of the disease, we searched publications diagnosing PaCa using miRNAs from PubMed, Medline, Embase, Google Scholar and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. The sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve were used to examine the overall test performance, and heterogeneity was analyzed with the I2 test.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis demonstrated that multiple miRNAs (SEN: 85\%; SPE: 89\%; AUC: 0.93) were more accurate for diagnosing PaCa than a single miRNA (SEN: 78\%; SPE: 79\%; AUC: 0.84), and future studies are still needed to confirm the diagnostic value of these pooled miRNAs for PaCa.},

Abnormal expression levels of miRs, regulating critical cancer-associated pathways, have been implicated to play important roles in the oncogenic processes, functioning both as oncogenes and as tumour suppressor genes. Elucidation of the genetic networks regulated by the abnormally expressing miRs in cancer cells is proving to be extremely significant in understanding the role of these miRs in the induction of malignant-transformation-associated phenotypic changes. As a result, the miRs involved in the oncogenic transformation process are being investigated as novel biomarkers of disease detection and prognosis as well as potential therapeutic targets for human cancers.

Differentially circulating miRNAs were subsequently validated in 88 pancreatic juice samples from 50 PDAC, 19 chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients and 19 NPNH controls. A marked difference in the profiles of four circulating miRNAs (miR-205, miR-210, miR-492, and miR-1427) was observed in pancreatic juice collected from patients with PDAC and those without pancreatic disease. Elevated levels of the four miRNAs together predicted PDAC with a specificity of 88\% and sensitivity of 87\%. Inclusion of serum CA19-9 level increased the sensitivity to 91\% and the specificity to 100\%. Enrichment of the four miRNAs in pancreatic juice was associated with decreased OS, as was the combination of miR-205 and miR-210.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) are pancreatic tumors with low malignant potential and good prognosis. However, differential diagnosis between SPN and pancreatic malignancies including pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PanNET) and ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is difficult. This study tried to identify candidate biomarkers for the distinction between SPN and the two malignant pancreatic tumors by examining the gene regulatory network of SPN.
METHODS: The gene regulatory network for SPN was constructed by a co-expression model. Genes that have been reported to be correlated with SPN were used as the clues to hunt more SPN-related genes in the network according to a shortest path approach. By means of the K-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN) classifier evaluated by the jackknife test, sets of genes to distinguish SPN and malignant pancreatic tumors were determined.
RESULTS: We took a new strategy to identify candidate biomarkers for differentiating SPN from the two malignant pancreatic tumors PanNET and PDAC by analyzing shortest paths among SPN-related genes in the gene regulatory network. 43 new SPN-relevant genes were discovered, among which, we found hsa-miR-194 and hsa-miR-7 along with 7 transcription factors (TFs) such as SOX11, SMAD3 and SOX4 etc. could correctly differentiate SPN from PanNET, while hsa-miR-204 and 4 TFs such as SOX9, TCF7 and PPARD etc. were demonstrated as the potential markers for SPN versus PDAC. 14 genes were demonstrated to serve as the candidate biomarkers for distinguishing SPN from PanNET and PDAC when considering them as malignant pancreatic tumors together.
CONCLUSION: This study provides new candidate genes related to SPN and the potential biomarkers to differentiate SPN from PanNET and PDAC, which may help to diagnose patients with SPN in clinical setting. Furthermore, candidate biomarkers such as SOX11 and hsa-miR-204 which could cause cell proliferation but inhibit invasion or metastasis may be of importance in understanding the molecular mechanism of pancreatic oncogenesis and could be possible therapeutic targets for malignant pancreatic tumors.},

Thirteen miRNAs (miR-138, miR-195, miR-204, miR-216a, miR-217, miR-218, miR-802, miR-155, miR-214, miR-26a, miR-30b, miR-31, and miR-125) were enriched and two miRNAs (miR-451a and miR-4284) were depleted in the cyst fluids derived from invasive carcinomas. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed that the relative abundance of tumor suppressor miR-216a and miR-217 varied significantly in these cyst fluid samples. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) analysis indicated that the genes targeted by the differentially enriched cyst fluid miRNAs are involved in five canonical signaling pathways, including molecular mechanisms of cancer and signaling pathways implicated in colorectal, ovarian and prostate cancers.

However, it is not clear whether this metabolic reprogramming promotes the growth of CAFs themselves. In this study, we found that the proliferation rate of CAFs was slower than NAFs, which was determined by cell counting, BrdU assay and flow cytometry analysis. Moreover, we found TGF-β signaling regulated cell growth of CAF through RNA-sequencing analysis and Western blot, which was further supported by the observation that TGF-β2 was highly expressed in colon cancer tissues. In the end, we demonstrated that CAFs were critical to tumor cell proliferation, which was supported by the evidence of their close localization in clinical tumor tissue and tumor promoting effect in mice. In brief, our data have manifested that the proliferation rate is decreased in CAFs, which enable CAFs generate more intermediate metabolites to support tumor cells growth, suggesting CAFs is an ideal target for tumor therapy.},

While studies on this topic are currently underway, clinical translation of ctDNA detection in various types of cancers has been attracting much attention, due to the great potential of ctDNA as blood-based biomarkers for early diagnosis and treatment of cancers. ctDNAs are detected and tracked primarily based on tumor-related genetic and epigenetic alterations. In this article, we reviewed the available studies on ctDNA detection and described the representative methods. We also discussed the current understanding of ctDNAs in cancer patients and their availability as potential biomarkers for clinical purposes. Considering the progress made and challenges involved in accurate detection of specific cell-free nucleic acids, ctDNAs hold promise to serve as biomarkers for cancer patients, and further validation is needed prior to their broad clinical use.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the prognostic value of different models in patients with early-stage diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
METHODS: Early-stage DLBCL patients diagnosed from January 2000 to December 2012 were analyzed retrospectively. All patients received with at least 2 cycles of immunochemotherapy R-CHOP regimen (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) with or without radiotherapy. The prognostic value of international prognostic index (IPI) , revised IPI (R-IPI) and enhanced IPI (NCCN-IPI) was compared.
RESULTS: Ninety-seven cases of early-stage DLBCL were included in the study. The median age was 58 years (15-88 years) with a median follow-up of 34.7 months (range 7.3-77.4 months). The expected 5-year overall survival (OS) for entire group was 82\%. There was no patient in the high risk group according to IPI or NCCN-IPI. According to IPI, the 5-year OS in the low, low intermediate, high intermediate risk groups were 95\%, 38\% and 60\%, respectively. According to R-IPI, the 5-year OS in the very good, good, and poor risk groups were 93\%, 75\% and 60\%, respectively. According to NCCN-IPI, the 5-year OS in the low, low intermediate, high intermediate risk groups were 92\%, 85\% and 29\%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: NCCN-IPI would be of an ideal prognostic model for early-stage DLBCL patients.},

Here we show that ATM is held inactive in unirradiated cells as a dimer and phosphorylates the opposite strand of the dimer in response to DNA damage. Cellular irradiation induces rapid intermolecular autophosphorylation of serine 1981 that causes dimer dissociation and initiates cellular ATM kinase activity. ATM cannot phosphorylate the substrates when it could not undergo dimer monomer transition. After DNA repair, the active monomer will undergo dephosphorylation to form dimer again and dephosphorylation is critical for dimer re-formation. Our work reveals novel function of ATM dimer monomer transition and explains why ATM dimer monomer transition plays such important role for ATM cellular activity during DNA repair.},

By comparing their respective DNA methylation level, we found that the DNA methylation pattern on the Y chromosome was stable among family members and haplogroups. Interestingly, two haplogroup-specific methylation sites were found, which were both genotype-dependent. Moreover, the African and Asian samples also had similar DNA methylation pattern with a remote divergence time.

In comparison with normal adjacent tissues, we observed that there were 6 aberrant methylation sites in prostate cancer tissues on the Y-chromosome. We further performed pyrosequencing using urine of PCa patients and we identified one methylated site (cg05163709) as a potential biomarker. We evaluated the predictive capacity of the aberrant methylated sites using the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The ROC analysis showed a higher AUC for cg05163709 (0.915) than prostate-specific antigen (PSA, 0.769).

Eighty-one (81/587, 13.8\%) patients were HBsAg-positive. Compared with HBsAg-negative DLBCL, HBsAg-positive DLBCL displayed a younger median onset age (45 vs. 55 years), more frequent involvement of spleen or retroperitoneal lymph node (40.7\% vs. 16.0\% and 61.7\% vs. 31.0\% respectively, both p {\textless} 0.001), more advanced disease (stage III/IV: 76.5\% vs 59.5\%, p = 0.003), and significantly worse outcome (2-year overall survival: 47\% versus 70\%, p {\textless} 0.001).

Although it is known that vascular-specific gene expression is regulated by cis-acting regulatory sequences in promoters, it is largely unknown how many regulatory elements exist and what their roles are in promoters. To understand the regulatory elements of vascular-specific promoters and their roles in vascular development, a T-DNA insertion mutant showing delayed growth and diminished resistance to environmental stress was isolated using promoter trap strategy. The novel gene, Arabidopsis thaliana heat shock protein-related (Athspr), was cloned from Arabidopsis ecotype C24. Strong GUS (β-glucuronidase) staining in the original promoter trap line was found in the vascular tissues of all organs in the mutant. The Athspr promoter was cloned and fused with GUS and eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) reporter genes to verify its vascular-specific expression in Arabidopsis. Further histochemical analysis in transgenic plants demonstrated a similar GUS expression pattern in the vascular tissues. In addition, ATHSPR-eGFP driven by Athspr promoter was observed in vascular bundles of the transgenic seedling roots. Finally, comparative analysis with promoter motifs from 37 genes involved in vascular development revealed that Athspr and all other promoters active in vascular tissues contained regulatory elements responding to phytohormones, light, biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as those regulating tissue-specific expression. These results demonstrated that the Athspr promoter has a vascular tissue-specific activity and Athspr may have multiple functions in vascular development and resistance against various stresses.},

Previous reports show that some members of the GATA protein family can also induce pluripotency in somatic cells by substituting for Oct4, a key pluripotency-associated factor. However, the mechanism linking lineage-specifying cues and the activation of pluripotency remains elusive. Here, we report that all GATA family members can substitute for Oct4 to induce pluripotency. We found that all members of the GATA family could inhibit the overrepresented ectodermal-lineage genes, which is consistent with previous reports indicating that a balance of different lineage-specifying forces is important for the restoration of pluripotency. A conserved zinc-finger DNA-binding domain in the C-terminus is critical for the GATA family to induce pluripotency. Using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, we determined that the pluripotency-related gene Sall4 is a direct target of GATA family members during reprogramming and serves as a bridge linking the lineage-specifying GATA family to the pluripotency circuit. Thus, the GATA family is the first protein family of which all members can function as inducers of the reprogramming process and can substitute for Oct4. Our results suggest that the role of GATA family in reprogramming has been underestimated and that the GATA family may serve as an important mediator of cell fate conversion.},

While many efforts have been made to improve reprogramming efficiency, significant problems such as genomic instability of iPSCs need to be addressed before clinical therapy. In this study, we try to figure out the real genomic state of iPSCs and their DNA damage response to ionizing radiation (IR). We found that iPSC line 3FB4-1 had lower DNA damage repair ability than mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, from which 3FB4-1line was derived. After the introduction of DNA damage by IR, the number of γ-H2AX foci in 3FB4-1 increased modestly compared to a large increase seen in MEF, albeit both significantly (P{\textless}0.01). In addition, whole-genome sequencing analysis showed that after IR, 3FB4-1 possessed more point mutations than MEF and the point mutations spread all over chromosomes. These observations provide evidence that iPSCs are more sensitive to ionizing radiation and their relatively low DNA damage repair capacity may account for their high radiosensitivity. The compromised DNA damage repair capacity of iPSCs should be considered when used in clinical therapy.},

	abstract = {Hypoxia inducible factor 1α (Hif1α) is a stress responsive transcription factor, which regulates the expression of genes required for adaption to hypoxia. Hif1α is normally hydroxylated by an oxygen-dependent prolylhydroxylase, leading to degradation and clearance of Hif1α from the cell. Under hypoxic conditions, the activity of the prolylhydroxylase is reduced and Hif1α accumulates. Hif1α is also constitutively expressed in tumor cells, where it is associated with resistance to ionizing radiation. Activation of the Hif1α transcriptional regulatory pathway may therefore function to protect normal cells from DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. Here, we utilized the prolylhydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) to elevate Hif1α levels in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to determine if DMOG could function as a radioprotector. The results demonstrate that DMOG increased Hif1α protein levels and decreased the sensitivity of MEFs to ionizing radiation. Further, the ability of DMOG to function as a radioprotector required Hif1α, indicating a key role for Hif1α's transcriptional activity. DMOG also induced the Hif1α -dependent accumulation of several DNA damage response proteins, including CHD4 and MTA3 (sub-units of the NuRD deacetylase complex) and the Suv39h1 histone H3 methyltransferase. Depletion of Suv39h1, but not CHD4 or MTA3, reduced the ability of DMOG to protect cells from radiation damage, implicating increased histone H3 methylation in the radioprotection of cells. Finally, treatment of mice with DMOG prior to total body irradiation resulted in significant radioprotection of the mice, demonstrating the utility of DMOG and related prolylhydroxylase inhibitors to protect whole organisms from ionizing radiation. Activation of Hif1α through prolylhydroxylase inhibition therefore identifies a new pathway for the development of novel radiation protectors.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Discovery of agents that protect or mitigate normal tissue from radiation injury during radiotherapy, accidents, or terrorist attacks is of importance. Specifically, bone marrow insufficiency, with possible infection due to immunosuppression, can occur after total body irradiation (TBI) or regional irradiation and is a major component of the acute radiation syndrome. The purpose of this study was to identify novel radioprotectors and mitigators of the hematopoietic system.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: High-throughput screening of small-molecule libraries was done using viability of a murine lymphocyte line as a readout with further validation in human lymphoblastoid cells. The selected compounds were then tested for their ability to counter TBI lethality in mice.
RESULTS: All of two major classes of antibiotics, tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, which share a common planar ring moiety, were radioprotective. Furthermore, tetracycline protected murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell populations from radiation damage and allowed 87.5\% of mice to survive when given before and 35\% when given 24 h after lethal TBI. Interestingly, tetracycline did not alter the radiosensitivity of Lewis lung cancer cells. Tetracycline and ciprofloxacine also protected human lymphoblastoid cells, reducing radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks by 33\% and 21\%, respectively. The effects of these agents on radiation lethality are not due to the classic mechanism of free radical scavenging but potentially through activation of the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase and altered chromatin structure.
CONCLUSIONS: Tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones can be robust radioprotectors and mitigators of the hematopoietic system with potential utility in anticancer radiotherapy and radiation emergencies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aminothiol WR1065 is a highly effective free radical scavenger which can protect cells from the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation. Currently, WR1065 is used clinically to protect patients from radiation injury occurring during radiation therapy protocols. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that WR1065 can alter radiosensitivity through a mechanism which is independent of its ability to function as a free radical scavenger. Here, we examined the ability of WR1065 to directly regulate signaling pathways involved in the DNA damage response.
METHODOLOGY: The ability of WR1065 to enhance the survival of irradiated bone marrow cells and primary cultures was established. DNA damage signaling was monitored by measuring activation of the ATM kinase by western blot analysis and activation of Tip60 using an in vitro acetylation assay. Tip60 function was abrogated by expression of a catalytically inactive Tip60, and the effect on radiosensitivity evaluated.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Treatment of cells with WR1065 led to a small but significant increase in the kinase activity of ATM. Further, WR1065 robustly activated the Tip60 acetyltransferase, which is a key upstream regulator of the ATM kinase. In addition, WR1065 directly activated the acetyltransferase activity of purified Tip60 in vitro, indicating a direct interaction between WR1065 and Tip60. Finally, cells with reduced levels of Tip60 activity exhibited a significant reduction in radioprotection by WR1065.
CONCLUSIONS: Direct regulation of Tip60's acetyltransferase activity by WR1065 makes a significant contribution to the radioprotective effects of WR1065. Activators of Tip60 may therefore make effective clinical radioprotectors.},

Tip60 is an acetyltransferase that acetylates both histones and ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase. Inactivation of Tip60 leads to defective DNA repair and increased cancer risk. However, how DNA damage activates the acetyltransferase activity of Tip60 is not known. Here, we show that direct interaction between the chromodomain of Tip60 and histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) at DSBs activates the acetyltransferase activity of Tip60. Depletion of intracellular H3K9me3 blocks activation of the acetyltransferase activity of Tip60, resulting in defective ATM activation and widespread defects in DSB repair. In addition, the ability of Tip60 to access H3K9me3 is dependent on the DNA damage-induced displacement of HP1beta (heterochromatin protein 1beta) from H3K9me3. Finally, we demonstrate that the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex targets Tip60 to H3K9me3, and is required to activate the acetyltransferase activity of Tip60. These results reveal a new function for H3K9me3 in coordinating activation of Tip60-dependent DNA repair pathways, and imply that aberrant patterns of histone methylation may contribute to cancer by altering the efficiency of DSB repair.},

Consequently, remodeling of the chromatin landscape adjacent to DSBs is vital for efficient DNA repair. Here, we demonstrate that DNA damage destabilizes nucleosomes within chromatin regions that correspond to the γ-H2AX domains surrounding DSBs. This nucleosome destabilization is an active process requiring the ATPase activity of the p400 SWI/SNF ATPase and histone acetylation by the Tip60 acetyltransferase. p400 is recruited to DSBs by a mechanism that is independent of ATM but requires mdc1. Further, the destabilization of nucleosomes by p400 is required for the RNF8-dependent ubiquitination of chromatin, and for the subsequent recruitment of brca1 and 53BP1 to DSBs. These results identify p400 as a novel DNA damage response protein and demonstrate that p400-mediated alterations in nucleosome and chromatin structure promote both chromatin ubiquitination and the accumulation of brca1 and 53BP1 at sites of DNA damage.},

The ATM protein kinase is a master regulator of the DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway. DSBs activate ATM's kinase activity, promoting the phosphorylation of proteins involved in both checkpoint activation and DNA repair. Recent work has revealed that two DNA damage response proteins, the Tip60 acetyltransferase and the mre11- rad50-nbs1 (MRN) complex, co-operate in the activation of ATM in response to DSBs. MRN functions to target ATM and the Tip60 acetyltransferase to DSBs. Tip60's chromodomain then interacts with histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 9, activating Tip60's acetyltransferase activity and stimulating the subsequent acetylation and activation of ATM's kinase activity. These results underscore the importance of chromatin structure in regulating DNA damage signaling and emphasize how histone modifications co-ordinate DNA repair. In addition, human tumors frequently exhibit altered patterns of histone methylation. This rewriting of the histone methylation code in tumor cells may impact the efficiency of DSB repair, increasing genomic instability and contributing to the initiation and progression of cancer.},

The activation of ATM's kinase activity involves acetylation of ATM by the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase. In this study, systematic mutagenesis of lysine residues was used to identify regulatory ATM acetylation sites. The results identify a single acetylation site at lysine 3016, which is located in the highly conserved C-terminal FATC domain adjacent to the kinase domain. Antibodies specific for acetyl-lysine 3016 demonstrate rapid (within 5 min) in vivo acetylation of ATM following exposure to bleomycin. Furthermore, lysine 3016 of ATM is a substrate in vitro for the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase. Mutation of lysine 3016 does not affect unstimulated ATM kinase activity but does abolish upregulation of ATM's kinase activity by DNA damage, inhibits the conversion of inactive ATM dimers to active ATM monomers, and prevents the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of the p53 and chk2 proteins. These results are consistent with a model in which acetylation of lysine 3016 in the FATC domain of ATM activates the kinase activity of ATM. The acetylation of ATM on lysine 3016 by Tip60 is therefore a key step linking the detection of DNA damage and the activation of ATM kinase activity.},

The activity of ATM kinase is activated by DNA damage, and this activation is required for cells to survive genotoxic events. In addition to this well characterized role in DNA repair, we now demonstrate a novel role for ATM in the retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells into post-mitotic, neuronal-like cells. RA rapidly activates the activity of ATM kinase, leading to the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of the CREB protein, extrusion of neuritic processes, and differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells into neuronal-like cells. When ATM protein expression was suppressed by short hairpin RNA, the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of CREB was blocked. Furthermore, ATM-negative cells failed to differentiate into neuronal-like cells when exposed to retinoic acid; instead, they underwent cell death. Expression of a constitutively active CREBVP16 construct, or exposure to forskolin to induce CREB phosphorylation, rescued ATM negative cells and restored differentiation. Furthermore, when dominant negative CREB proteins with mutations in either the CREB phosphorylation site (CREBS133A) or the DNA binding domain (KCREB) were introduced into SH-SY5Y cells, retinoic acid-induced differentiation was blocked and the cells underwent cell death. The results demonstrate that ATM is required for the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells through the ATM dependent-phosphorylation of serine 133 of CREB. These results therefore define a novel mechanism for activation of the activity of ATM kinase by RA, and implicate ATM in the regulation of CREB function during RA-induced differentiation.},

The FATC domain of ATM mediates the interaction between ATM and Tip60, a histone acetyltransferase that regulates activation of ATM. Here, we examined whether the FATC domains of DNA-PKcs, Atr, and Trrap were also able to interact with Tip60. Deletion of the FATC domain of ATM blocked the interaction between ATM and Tip60 and suppressed the activation of ATM kinase activity by DNA damage. Replacement of the FATC domain of ATM with the FATC domains of DNA-PKcs, Atr, or Trrap restored the activation of ATM and its association with Tip60. These results indicate that the FATC domains of DNA-PKcs, Atr, Trrap, and ATM are functionally equivalent. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Tip60 is constitutively associated with DNA-PKcs and that the histone acetyltransferase activity associated with DNA-PKcs is up-regulated by DNA damage. When Tip60 expression was suppressed by small interfering RNA, the activation of DNA-PKcs (measured by autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at serine 2056 and threonine 2609) was inhibited, demonstrating a key role for Tip60 in the activation of DNA-PKcs by DNA damage. The conserved FATC domain of PIKK proteins may therefore function as a binding domain for the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase.

Deletion studies demonstrated that amino acids 1-150 of ATM were required for the ATM protein to regulate cellular radiosensitivity. Additional deletions and point mutations indicated that this domain extended from amino acids 81-106 of ATM, with amino acid substitutions located between amino acids 91 and 97 inactivating the functional activity of ATM. When ATM with mutations in this region (termed ATM90) was expressed in AT cells, it was unable to restore normal radiosensitivity to the cells. However, ATM90 retained normal kinase activity and was autophosphorylated on serine 1981 following exposure to DNA damage. Furthermore, wild-type ATM displayed DNA-damage induced association with p53, brca1, and LKB1 in vivo, whereas ATM90 failed to form productive complexes with these target proteins either in vivo or in vitro. Furthermore, ATM90 did not phosphorylate p53 in vivo and did not form nuclear foci in response to ionizing radiation.

As the funding circulates through the scientific community it is mathematically expected to converge on a funding distribution favored by the entire scientific community. This is achieved without any proposal submissions or reviews. The model furthermore funds scientists instead of projects, reducing much of the overhead and bias of the present grant peer review system. Model validation using large-scale citation data and funding records over the past 20 years show that the proposed model could yield funding distributions that are similar to those of the NSF and NIH, and the model could potentially be more fair and more equitable. We discuss possible extensions of this approach as well as science policy implications.},

	abstract = {Aging is associated with sarcopenia, which is a loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is involved in several important functions that are related to bioenergetics and protection against oxidative damage; however, the role of CoQ10 as a determinant of muscular strength is not well documented. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the determinants of muscular strength by examining hand grip force in relation to CoQ10 status, gender, age and body mass index (BMI) in two independent cohorts (n = 334, n = 967). Furthermore, peak flow as a function of respiratory muscle force was assessed. Spearman’s correlation revealed a significant positive association between CoQ10/cholesterol level and hand grip in the basic study population (p{\textless}0.01) as well as in the validation population (p{\textless}0.001). In the latter, we also found a negative correlation with the CoQ10 redox state (p{\textless}0.01), which represents a lower percentage of the reduced form of CoQ10 (ubiquinol) in subjects who exhibit a lower muscular strength. Furthermore, the age of the subjects showed a negative correlation with hand grip (p{\textless}0.001), whereas BMI was positively correlated with hand grip (p{\textless}0.01), although only in the normal weight subgroup (BMI {\textless}25 kg/m2). Analysis of the covariance (ANCOVA) with hand grip as the dependent variable revealed CoQ10/cholesterol as a determinant of muscular strength and gender as the strongest effector of hand grip. In conclusion, our data suggest that both a low CoQ10/cholesterol level and a low percentage of the reduced form of CoQ10 could be an indicator of an increased risk of sarcopenia in humans due to their negative associations to upper body muscle strength, peak flow and muscle mass.},

Findings from this study revealed six core theoretical variables along with 28 influential factors that were salient across interviews and supported by research literature. The synthesis of findings led to the development of a model that draws upon the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to investigate scientists’ intentions and behavior towards the reuse of research data. The proposed model offers a novel approach to the current base of knowledge that has been essentially exploratory and atheoretical in nature. It also serves as the foundation for a future larger scale research that expects to provide guidelines for policymakers, open data advocates, and data repository stakeholders to better attune policies and repositories to scientists’ expectations and needs.},

This study analyses the solutions offered by generalist scientific data repositories, i.e., repositories supporting the deposition of any type of research data. These repositories cannot make any assumption on the application domain. They are actually called to face with the almost open ended typologies of data used in science. The current practices promoted by such repositories are analysed with respect to eight key aspects of data publishing, i.e., dataset formatting, documentation, licensing, publication costs, validation, availability, discovery and access, and citation. From this analysis it emerges that these repositories implement well consolidated practices and pragmatic solutions for literature repositories. These practices and solutions can not totally meet the needs of management and use of datasets resources, especially in a context where rapid technological changes continuously open new exploitation prospects.},

	abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are traditionally associated with cancer through their abilities to cause chromosomal instabilities or gene mutations. Here we report a new class of self-inflicted DNA DSBs that can drive tumor growth irrespective of their effects on genomic stability. We discover a mechanism through which cancer cells cause DSBs in their own genome spontaneously independent of reactive oxygen species or replication stress. In this mechanism, low-level cytochrome c leakage from the mitochondria leads to sublethal activation of apoptotic caspases and nucleases, which causes DNA DSBs. In response to these spontaneous DNA DSBs, ATM, a key factor involved in DNA damage response, is constitutively activated. Activated ATM leads to activation of transcription factors NF-κB and STAT3, known drivers of tumor growth. Moreover, self-inflicted DNA DSB formation and ATM activation are important in sustaining the stemness of patient-derived glioma cells. In human tumor tissues, elevated levels of activated ATM correlate with poor patient survival. Self-inflicted DNA DSBs therefore are functionally important for maintaining the malignancy of cancer cells.},

We examined the effect of initiation of complementary feeding at 4 months versus 6 months of corrected age on weight for age at 12 months corrected age in preterm infants less than 34 weeks of gestation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this open-label, randomised trial, we enrolled infants born at less than 34 weeks of gestation with no major malformation from three public health facilities in India. Eligible infants were tracked from birth and randomly assigned (1:1) at 4 months corrected age to receive complementary feeding at 4 months corrected age (4 month group), or continuation of milk feeding and initiation of complementary feeding at 6 months corrected age (6 month group), using computer generated randomisation schedule of variable block size, stratified by gestation (30 weeks or less, and 31–33 weeks). Iron supplementation was provided as standard. Participants and the implementation team could not be masked to group assignment, but outcome assessors were masked. Primary outcome was weight for age \textit{Z}-score at 12 months corrected age (WAZ$_{\textrm{12}}$) based on WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study growth standards. Analyses were by intention to treat. The trial is registered with Clinical Trials Registry of India, number CTRI/2012/11/003149.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Between March 20, 2013, and April 24, 2015, 403 infants were randomly assigned: 206 to receive complementary feeding from 4 months and 197 to receive complementary feeding from 6 months. 22 infants in the 4 month group (four deaths, two withdrawals, 16 lost to follow-up) and eight infants in the 6 month group (two deaths, six lost to follow-up) were excluded from analysis of primary outcome. There was no difference in WAZ$_{\textrm{12}}$ between two groups: −1·6 (SD 1·2) in the 4 month group versus −1·6 (SD 1·3) in the 6 month group (mean difference 0·005, 95\% CI −0·24 to 0·25; p=0·965). There were more hospital admissions in the 4 month group compared with the 6 month group: 2·5 episodes per 100 infant-months in the 4 month group versus 1·4 episodes per 100 infant-months in the 6 month group (incidence rate ratio 1·8, 95\% CI 1·0–3·1, p=0·03). 34 (18\%) of 188 infants in the 4 month group required hospital admission, compared with 18 (9\%) of 192 infants in the 6 month group.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Although there was no evidence of effect for the primary endpoint of WAZ$_{\textrm{12}}$, the higher rate of hospital admission in the 4 month group suggests a recommendation to initiate complementary feeding at 6 months over 4 months of corrected age in infants less than 34 weeks of gestation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Indian Council of Medical Research supported the study until Nov 14, 2015.

	abstract = {It is difficult to accurately evaluate the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which leads to the uncertainty and complexity of dose-effect analysis. In this study we established the “Focus” mode of biomarkers to characterize the dose-effect relationship of Gegen Qinlian Decoction (GQD), a TCM formula for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (2-DM). A rat model of 2-DM was established through high fat diet feeding combined with low-dose STZ injection. Rats with 2-DM were administered high, middle or low doses (6.785, 4.071, 1.357 mg·kg−1·d−1, respectively) of GQD extract for 60 d. Metformin (300 mg·kg−1·d−1) was taken as the positive control. Blood samples were collected to assess serum biochemical indexes and metabolic profiling. After “Focus” analysis, the biochemical index triglycerides (TG) and insulin sensitivity (ISI) were identified as focused integrated biomarkers (FIBs), while arachidonic acid and docosatetraenoic acid were the metabolic FIBs. Dose-effect relationship curves of GQD were built based on these types of FIBs. Furthermore, the two dose-effect relationship curves showed similar trends with the middle dosage displaying the greatest efficacy, suggesting that insulin function and arachidonic acid metabolism played important roles in 2-DM and the responses to GQD. The metabolic FIB docosatetraenoic should be further explored for understanding its involvement in the process of 2-DM occurrence and the treatment. This “Focus” mode provides a novel strategy to evaluate the dose-effect relationship of a TCM. The system and concepts established here may also be applicable for assessing the dose-effect relationships of Western medicines.},

	abstract = {Biliary atresia is a rare, devastating disease of infants where a fibroinflammatory process destroys the bile ducts, leading to fibrosis and biliary cirrhosis, and death if untreated. The cause and pathogenesis remain largely unknown. We tried to investigate factors involved in biliary atresia, especially forkhead box A3 (Foxa3), which might exert a role in the treatment of liver disease. We used RNA sequencing to sequence the whole transcriptomes of livers from six biliary atresia and six choledochal cysts patients. Then, we employed a rat disease model by bile duct ligation (BDL) and adenovirus transduction to address the function of Foxa3 in biliary atresia. We found that tight junction, adherence junction, cell cycle, apoptosis, chemokine singling, VEGF and MAPK signaling pathways were enriched in biliary atresia livers. We showed that Foxa3 expression was notably decreased in liver samples from biliary atresia patients. More importantly, we found that its lower expression predicted a poorer overall survival of biliary atresia patients. Rats that received BDL surgery and Foxa3 expression adenovirus resulted in a significant decrease in the deposition of collagen, and expression of profibrotic cytokines (transforming growth factor-β and connective tissue growth factor) and fibrosis markers (α-smooth muscle actin, collagen I and collagen III), as compared with rats that received BDL surgery and control adenovirus. Our data suggested a protection role for Foxa3 during the progression of liver fibrosis in biliary atresia, and thereby supported increasing Foxa3 as a targeted treatment strategy.},

	abstract = {Research policy observers are increasingly concerned about the potential impact of current academic working conditions on mental health, particularly in PhD students. The aim of the current study is threefold. First, we assess the prevalence of mental health problems in a representative sample of PhD students in Flanders, Belgium (N = 3659). Second, we compare PhD students to three other samples: (1) highly educated in the general population (N = 769); (2) highly educated employees (N = 592); and (3) higher education students (N = 333). Third, we assess those organizational factors relating to the role of PhD students that predict mental health status. Results based on 12 mental health symptoms (GHQ-12) showed that 32\% of PhD students are at risk of having or developing a common psychiatric disorder, especially depression. This estimate was significantly higher than those obtained in the comparison groups. Organizational policies were significantly associated with the prevalence of mental health problems. Especially work-family interface, job demands and job control, the supervisor’s leadership style, team decision-making culture, and perception of a career outside academia are linked to mental health problems.},

Of note, MVO is a strong negative prognosticator associated with a higher prevalence of arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, tamponade, early congestive heart failure, adverse left ventricular remodelling, readmissions for heart failure and mortality (1).},

	shorttitle = {"{Equal}" contributions and credit},
	doi = {10.1016/j.annepidem.2010.08.004},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Scientific manuscripts sometimes have two or more authors explicitly designated as having "contributed equally" to the study. The prevalence and characteristics of this practice are not known. The goal of this study was to identify longitudinal trends and characteristics of the practice of explicitly giving authors equal credit in publications found in major medical journals.
METHODS: We conducted electronic keyword searches looking for original research articles with equally credited authors (ECAs) published between Jan. 1, 2000 and Dec. 31, 2009 in the five general medicine journals with the highest impact factors (New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association, Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine, and British Medical Journal). The annual prevalence of original research articles with ECAs for each journal.
RESULTS: Original research articles with authors explicitly given equal credit were found in all five journals. Articles with ECAs formed a greater proportion of the total number of articles published in each journal in 2009 versus published in 2000 (NEJM: 8.6\% vs. {\textless}1\%; JAMA: 7.5\% vs. 0\%; Annals: 3.8\% vs. 0\%; Lancet: 3.6\% vs. {\textless}1\%; BMJ: 1.0\% vs. 0\%). There was a statistically significant increasing trend in yearly prevalence of ECA articles for all the journals (NEJM: p {\textless} 0.0001; JAMA: p {\textless} 0.001; Annals: p {\textless} 0.001; Lancet: p {\textless} 0.001, BMJ: p = 0.001]. The first two authors listed in the byline received equal credit the majority of the time, but the practice was also applied to authors in nearly every position in the byline. Finally, none of the journals provided specific guidance regarding this practice in their instructions to authors.
CONCLUSIONS: The practice of explicitly giving authors equal credit is increasingly common in original research publications. Scientific journals should consider providing guidance for authors regarding this practice. Furthermore, the potential impact of this practice on evaluations for academic promotion should be assessed.},

	abstract = {Once considered provocative, the notion that the wisdom of the crowd is superior to any individual has become itself a piece of crowd wisdom, leading to speculation that online voting may soon put credentialed experts out of business. Recent applications include political and economic forecasting, evaluating nuclear safety, public policy, the quality of chemical probes, and possible responses to a restless volcano. Algorithms for extracting wisdom from the crowd are typically based on a democratic voting procedure. They are simple to apply and preserve the independence of personal judgment. However, democratic methods have serious limitations. They are biased for shallow, lowest common denominator information, at the expense of novel or specialized knowledge that is not widely shared. Adjustments based on measuring confidence do not solve this problem reliably. Here we propose the following alternative to a democratic vote: select the answer that is more popular than people predict. We show that this principle yields the best answer under reasonable assumptions about voter behaviour, while the standard ‘most popular’ or ‘most confident’ principles fail under exactly those same assumptions. Like traditional voting, the principle accepts unique problems, such as panel decisions about scientific or artistic merit, and legal or historical disputes. The potential application domain is thus broader than that covered by machine learning and psychometric methods, which require data across multiple questions.},

	abstract = {The scarcity of tissue-specific stem cells and the complexity of their surrounding environment have made molecular characterization of these cells particularly challenging. Through single-cell transcriptome and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we uncovered molecular properties of CD133(+)/GFAP(-) ependymal (E) cells in the adult mouse forebrain neurogenic zone. Surprisingly, prominent hub genes of the gene network unique to ependymal CD133(+)/GFAP(-) quiescent cells were enriched for immune-responsive genes, as well as genes encoding receptors for angiogenic factors. Administration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activated CD133(+) ependymal neural stem cells (NSCs), lining not only the lateral but also the fourth ventricles and, together with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), elicited subsequent neural lineage differentiation and migration. This study revealed the existence of dormant ependymal NSCs throughout the ventricular surface of the CNS, as well as signals abundant after injury for their activation.},

This integrative review sought to explore the key issues concerning authorship from a bioethical standpoint, aiming to explore the key features of the authorship debate. Studies were identified through an electronic search, using the PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Scopus databases of peer-reviewed research, published between 2009 and 2014, limited to English language research, with search terms developed to reflect the current issues of authorship. From among the 279 papers identified, 20 research papers met the inclusion criteria. Findings were compiled and then arranged to identify themes and relationships. The review incorporated a wide range of authorship issues encompassing equal-credited authors, honorary (guest/gift) and ghost authorship, perception/experiences of authorship, and guidelines/policies. This review suggests that the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors' (ICMJE) recommended guidelines for authorship are not reflected in current authorship practices within the domain of health sciences in both low-and high-impact-factor journals. This devaluing of the true importance of authorship has the potential to affect the validity of authorship, diminish the real contributions of the true authors, and negatively affect patient care.},

However, many genes linked to human diseases do not have orthologs in such model organisms, or they require an appropriate cellular context to display their disease-relevant phenotypes. The wish for a facile method to disrupt gene function in somatic mammalian cells appeared to be granted with the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) (or short hairpin RNA, shRNA), which brought with them great promise—particularly for discovering novel drug targets through the use of genetic screens (1–3). However, the honeymoon is now over, and although some new discoveries have been made, the yield has fallen far short of expectations. Many drug targets identified by means of si/shRNA technology in academic laboratories are not robust when tested in industrial laboratories (4, 5). Avoiding this fate requires a more sophisticated interpretation of si/shRNA results, especially in the context of high-throughput screens.
Realizing the full potential of si/shRNA technology requires more sophisticated approaches to address the pitfalls.

	abstract = {Repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs) is particularly challenging in pericentromeric heterochromatin, where the abundance of repeated sequences exacerbates the risk of ectopic recombination and chromosome rearrangements. Recent studies in Drosophila cells revealed that faithful homologous recombination (HR) repair of heterochromatic DSBs relies on the relocalization of DSBs to the nuclear periphery before Rad51 recruitment. We summarize here the exciting progress in understanding this pathway, including conserved responses in mammalian cells and surprising similarities with mechanisms in yeast that deal with DSBs in distinct sites that are difficult to repair, including other repeated sequences. We will also point out some of the most important open questions in the field and emerging evidence suggesting that deregulating these pathways might have dramatic consequences for human health., Heterochromatic DSB repair is spatially and temporally regulated by SUMOylation and SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs)., DSBs leave the heterochromatin domain before recruiting Rad51 and continuing HR repair in Drosophila and mouse cells, revealing conserved repair pathways., SUMOylation blocks HR progression inside the heterochromatin domain, thus preventing aberrant recombination among repeated sequences on different chromosomes., ‘Safe’ HR repair of heterochromatic DSBs continues at nuclear pores and inner nuclear membrane proteins at the nuclear periphery in Drosophila cells., The mechanisms regulating heterochromatin repair in space and time show striking similarities with pathways in yeast that deal with other DSBs that are difficult to repair, including in rDNA, collapsed forks, and eroded telomeres., Heterochromatin instability is emerging as a potential driving force for tumorigenesis and other aging-related human disorders.},

	abstract = {Phosphorylation of the α-subunit of initiation factor 2 (eIF2) controls protein synthesis by a conserved mechanism. In metazoa, distinct stress conditions activate different eIF2α kinases (PERK, PKR, GCN2, and HRI) that converge on phosphorylating a unique serine in eIF2α. This collection of signaling pathways is termed the 'integrated stress response' (ISR). eIF2α phosphorylation diminishes protein synthesis, while allowing preferential translation of some mRNAs. Starting with a cell-based screen for inhibitors of PERK signaling, we identified a small molecule, named ISRIB, that potently (IC50 = 5 nM) reverses the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation. ISRIB reduces the viability of cells subjected to PERK-activation by chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress. eIF2α phosphorylation is implicated in memory consolidation. Remarkably, ISRIB-treated mice display significant enhancement in spatial and fear-associated learning. Thus, memory consolidation is inherently limited by the ISR, and ISRIB releases this brake. As such, ISRIB promises to contribute to our understanding and treatment of cognitive disorders. DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00498.001.},

ISRIB, a potent drug-like small molecule, renders cells insensitive to eIF2α phosphorylation and enhances cognitive function in rodents by blocking long-term depression. ISRIB was identified in a phenotypic cell-based screen, and its mechanism of action remained unknown. We now report that ISRIB is an activator of eIF2B. Our reporter-based shRNA screen revealed an eIF2B requirement for ISRIB activity. Our results define ISRIB as a symmetric molecule, show ISRIB-mediated stabilization of activated eIF2B dimers, and suggest that eIF2B4 (δ-subunit) contributes to the ISRIB binding site. We also developed new ISRIB analogs, improving its EC50 to 600 pM in cell culture. By modulating eIF2B function, ISRIB promises to be an invaluable tool in proof-of-principle studies aiming to ameliorate cognitive defects resulting from neurodegenerative diseases.},

Studies on animal models of drug addiction indicate that persistent long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission onto ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons is a critical component of sustained drug seeking. However, little is known about the mechanism regulating such long-lasting changes in synaptic strength. Previously, we identified that translational control by eIF2α phosphorylation (p-eIF2α) regulates cocaine-induced LTP in the VTA (Huang et al., 2016). Here we report that in mice with reduced p-eIF2α-mediated translation, cocaine induces persistent LTP in VTA DA neurons. Moreover, selectively inhibiting eIF2α-mediated translational control with a small molecule ISRIB, or knocking down oligophrenin-1-an mRNA whose translation is controlled by p-eIF2α-in the VTA also prolongs cocaine-induced LTP. This persistent LTP is mediated by the insertion of GluR2-lacking AMPARs. Collectively, our findings suggest that eIF2α-mediated translational control regulates the progression from transient to persistent cocaine-induced LTP.},

Herein we describe structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of bis-O-arylglycolamides, first-in-class integrated stress response inhibitors (ISRIB). ISRIB analogues make cells insensitive to the effects of eIF2α-P by activating the GEF activity of eIF2B and allowing global protein synthesis to proceed with residual unphosphorylated eIF2α.

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.05033},
	abstract = {Previously, we identified ISRIB as a potent inhibitor of the integrated stress response (ISR) and showed that ISRIB makes cells resistant to the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation and enhances long-term memory in rodents (Sidrauski et al., 2013). Here, we show by genome-wide in vivo ribosome profiling that translation of a restricted subset of mRNAs is induced upon ISR activation. ISRIB substantially reversed the translational effects elicited by phosphorylation of eIF2α and induced no major changes in translation or mRNA levels in unstressed cells. eIF2α phosphorylation-induced stress granule (SG) formation was blocked by ISRIB. Strikingly, ISRIB addition to stressed cells with pre-formed SGs induced their rapid disassembly, liberating mRNAs into the actively translating pool. Restoration of mRNA translation and modulation of SG dynamics may be an effective treatment of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by eIF2α phosphorylation, SG formation, and cognitive loss.},

	abstract = {孙学军京都大学的Kazutoshi Mori和加州大学圣弗朗西斯科分校的Peter Walter获得2014年“拉斯克基础医学奖”，获奖理由是“发现非折叠蛋白反应——一条综合的细胞内信号通路，他们的研究发现细胞能检测到内质网中蛋白质有害的错误折叠，并反馈给细胞核采取保护措施。”内质网是负责对细胞分泌蛋白和细胞膜蛋白进行翻译后修饰折叠的工厂，内质网一旦发现这些蛋白质出现折叠错误，将会发出信号给细胞核，激活可以修改这些错误的基因。这些研究对囊性纤维化和视网膜色素变性等疾病提供了分子解释。曾经有86位拉斯克基础医学奖获得者最终获得了诺贝尔奖，因此拉斯克基础医学奖被誉为诺贝尔奖的热身奖。显然，“未折叠蛋白质应答”的研究成为今年生理医学诺贝尔奖的可能性大增，虽然许多人对这个未折叠蛋白质应答心存疑虑，但生命科学领域的人，尤其是医学领域的学者对另一个概念并不生疏，那就是内质网应激。因为这个内质网应激已经和炎症反应、细胞凋亡、氧化应激等共同成为解释许多疾病的工作手段或范式。内质网是真核细胞内蛋白质合成、脂质生成和钙离子贮存的主要场所。分泌性和膜蛋白需要在内质网中折叠、组装、加工、包装及向高尔基体转运，},

Similar to Cas9, endonucleases from the Argonaute protein family also use oligonucleotides as guides to degrade invasive genomes. Here we report that the Natronobacterium gregoryi Argonaute (NgAgo) is a DNA-guided endonuclease suitable for genome editing in human cells. NgAgo binds 5′ phosphorylated single-stranded guide DNA (gDNA) of {\textasciitilde}24 nucleotides, efficiently creates site-specific DNA double-strand breaks when loaded with the gDNA. The NgAgo–gDNA system does not require a protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), as does Cas9, and preliminary characterization suggests a low tolerance to guide–target mismatches and high efficiency in editing (G+C)-rich genomic targets.},

	abstract = {Historically, admissions committees for biomedical Ph.D. programs have heavily weighed GRE scores when considering applications for admission. The predictive validity of GRE scores on graduate student success is unclear, and there have been no recent investigations specifically on the relationship between general GRE scores and graduate student success in biomedical research. Data from Vanderbilt University Medical School’s biomedical umbrella program were used to test to what extent GRE scores can predict outcomes in graduate school training when controlling for other admissions information. Overall, the GRE did not prove useful in predicating who will graduate with a Ph.D., pass the qualifying exam, have a shorter time to defense, deliver more conference presentations, publish more first author papers, or obtain an individual grant or fellowship. GRE scores were found to be moderate predictors of first semester grades, and weak to moderate predictors of graduate GPA and some elements of a faculty evaluation. These findings suggest admissions committees of biomedical doctoral programs should consider minimizing their reliance on GRE scores to predict the important measures of progress in the program and student productivity.},

	abstract = {Many US biomedical PhD programs receive more applications for admissions than they can accept each year, necessitating a selective admissions process. Typical selection criteria include standardized test scores, undergraduate grade point average, letters of recommendation, a resume and/or personal statement highlighting relevant research or professional experience, and feedback from interviews with training faculty. Admissions decisions are often founded on assumptions that these application components correlate with research success in graduate school, but these assumptions have not been rigorously tested. We sought to determine if any application components were predictive of student productivity measured by first-author student publications and time to degree completion. We collected productivity metrics for graduate students who entered the umbrella first-year biomedical PhD program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 2008–2010 and analyzed components of their admissions applications. We found no correlations of test scores, grades, amount of previous research experience, or faculty interview ratings with high or low productivity among those applicants who were admitted and chose to matriculate at UNC. In contrast, ratings from recommendation letter writers were significantly stronger for students who published multiple first-author papers in graduate school than for those who published no first-author papers during the same timeframe. We conclude that the most commonly used standardized test (the general GRE) is a particularly ineffective predictive tool, but that qualitative assessments by previous mentors are more likely to identify students who will succeed in biomedical graduate research. Based on these results, we conclude that admissions committees should avoid over-reliance on any single component of the application and de-emphasize metrics that are minimally predictive of student productivity. We recommend continual tracking of desired training outcomes combined with retrospective analysis of admissions practices to guide both application requirements and holistic application review.},

An important problem in embryology is whether the differentiation of cells depends upon a stable restriction of the genetic information contained in their nuclei. The technique of nuclear transplantation has shown to what extent the nuclei of differentiating cells can promote the formation of different cell types (e.g. King \& Briggs, 1956; Gurdon, 1960c). Yet no experiments have so far been published on the transplantation of nuclei from fully differentiated normal cells. This is partly because it is difficult to obtain meaningful results from such experiments. The small amount of cytoplasm in differentiated cells renders their nuclei susceptible to damage through exposure to the saline medium, and this makes it difficult to assess the significance of the abnormalities resulting from their transplantation. It is, however, very desirable to know the developmental capacity of such nuclei, since any nuclear changes which are necessarily involved in cellular differentiation must have already taken place in cells of this kind.},

	abstract = {近年来高通量测序技术(High-throughput sequencing)蓬勃发展,不断地取得新的突破,逐渐引领人类进入后基因组时代。高通量测序技术相较于传统的芯片与低通量测序,可以更高效快速地得到海量基因组、转录组、表观组等组学数据,并能在全组学层面测定探索未知序列。这一里程碑式的变革使得对生物进行细致全貌的分析成为可能,进而从全新角度来解决生物学问题。与此同时,微生物基因组学在医学、工农业等有着重要的应用前景,目前也有很多全球国际项目如NIH人类微生物群系项目(Human Microbiome Project,HMP)、地球环境微生物计划(Earth Microbiome Project,EMP)。将高通量测序技术与微生物组学进行结合,恰好可以在微生物领域发挥重要作用。例如在未知病原微生物检测、突发传染病防控方面,可通过测序来快速地鉴定病原体,并通过溯源进化分析推断病原体与宿主可能的来源和研究传播途径,甚至进一步分析病原体毒力与耐药信息;而在宏基因组学领域,可通过海量的测序数据对微生态多样性、代谢功能富集等进行分析,从而研究特定表型与宏基因组的内在关联。在高通量测序技术广泛应用于微生物组学领域的同时,也给微生物组学的大数据分析带来了新的挑战。高通量测序数据类型多样、产出数据量大、待分析的生物学问题高度个性化,势必需要一种普适有效的生物信息学分析流程来解决这些问题。本研究综合使用多种生物信息学分析方法,对海量测序数据的微生物辨识、进化与微生物耐药性等一系列关键问题进行逐项论述和研究。本研究首先通过对相关理论和算法进行了深入比较讨论,不仅提出通用高效的微生物辨识分析方法,也针对不同类型特性的测序数据给出更优化的分析策略。而后基于微生物组测序数据的辨识结果,进一步讨论了微生物的系统进化分析原理与方法,包括基于高通量测序数据的微生物亲缘关系、分歧时间、基因进化速率、蛋白家族、菌株间重组等的分析。此外,也阐述了微生物组学的功能性相关分析方法,尤其是基于微生物测序数据的耐药性研究。最后,总结了文中有关微生物的系列研究分析方法,归纳提出了基于高通量测序数据的微生物的系统通用分析流程模式。在海量测序数据中如何进行快速、精准地辨识出微生物相关信息,对病原微生物检测、突发传染性疾病防控、食品安全检测等领域至关重要。针对这一问题展开研究,本研究首先即是讨论基于测序数据的高效准确分析方法。常规的病原体辨识方法主要包含比对和拼接两大类基本计算,而每一类又有更多的细致分类,需根据不同情况构造针对性的方法流程才能得到可靠的微生物辨识结果。文中以主流成熟的算法为主,通过归纳比较现有的多种平行分析算法与流程的效率与准确度,得出适合于微生物测序数据的通用分析辨识方法。不仅如此,文中亦对不同的测序数据类型和应用情况提出了优化的分析策略指导建议。研究中以典型的dna与rna病毒病原体为例,基于大量全面的仿真数据、实测数据和公开数据集进行测试和验证,深入系统地论证了在不同测序深度、测序读长、乃至混合感染、基因组融合与重组等情况下采取何种分析模式能够取得更好的病原体辨识效果,最终得到更优化的分析解决方案。溯源进化分析作为常见的生物信息学分析之一,在微生物辨识分类、生物进化机制研究方面有着重要作用。本研究主要对基于高通量测序数据的微生物进化分析方法进行研究,首先介绍进化分析的相关背景和理论基础,而后以幽门螺杆菌(helicobacterpylori)多重感染的实测病例数据为切入,讨论针对同种菌群的微进化分析。高通量测序技术的迅猛发展产生了前所未有的分子水平数据,这给传统的系统发生学带来了革命性的变化。基于全组学数据,不仅能得到更全面丰富的信息,也能减少传统基于特定基因组区域数据方法的偏性和误差。文中对基于高通量测序数据的进化分析相关理论和方法进行了细致的介绍,包括高通量测序数据在进化分析前的预处理、进化模型的构建原理以及选择方法、进化树的多种计算和评估方法等等。本研究中也包含了对多重感染幽门螺杆菌数据分析的实例介绍。在这一例慢性浅表性胃炎病患的活检样本中,分离出多达18株幽门螺杆菌克隆。随后在对菌群的微进化分析中,相比于仅考虑点突变的传统方法,文中还将重组事件纳入考虑。通过这种方法更准确地重构其多重感染病史,并计算得到不同感染阶段对应的分歧时间。特别的是,在微进化分析中,所有幽门螺杆菌分为两大不同特点的谱系分支,进化主要驱动因素为基因组重组且两分支进化速率有数量级上的差异。进一步对重组模式以及限制修饰系统的分析发现,高进化速率分支菌群的限制修饰系统缺陷可能是造成其更易发生重组事件的原因。此外,多菌株长期在宿主体内定植的微进化过程中,不同分支菌株通过基于交流,基因组的差异在近几年尺度上有逐渐减少趋同的倾向。论文这一部分对基于高通量测序数据的微生物进化分析进行了从理论到实例的详细介绍,既有通用的一般分析方法,也有个性化分析策略举例,可作为方法学上的指导和参考。微生物的耐药性分析对疾病的用药治疗有着重要意义。在耐药性分析方面,论文中以金黄色葡萄球菌的耐药性研究为例进行介绍。我们在猪源金黄色葡萄球菌中发现了对国内尚未上市新药达福普汀/喹努普丁(qda)的超前耐药性,对三株具有此种耐药性的金黄色葡萄球菌进行全基因组测序和分析研究,最终发现其对qda的耐药性源自编码atp结合盒式转运蛋白的lsa(e)基因。我们通过进一步的比较基因组分析发现,所有三株qda耐药的猪源金黄色葡萄球菌在iii型限制修饰系统方面的基因。此部分研究涉及的耐药基因分析、葡萄球菌染色体mec基因盒(staphyloccoccalcassettechromosomemec,sccmec)分析及比较基因组分析等方法,均可作为同类耐药性分析研究的参考。论文的最后对全文工作进行了简要总结,归纳了文中基于高通量测序数据的微生物辨识、进化与耐药性等的每一项分析系统通用分析流程模式,并对未来的工作计划做进一步的展望。},

Here we employ CAPP-Seq ctDNA analysis to study resistance mechanisms in 43 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with the third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor rociletinib. We observe multiple resistance mechanisms in 46\% of patients after treatment with first-line inhibitors, indicating frequent intra-patient heterogeneity. Rociletinib resistance recurrently involves MET, EGFR, PIK3CA, ERRB2, KRAS and RB1. We describe a novel EGFR L798I mutation and find that EGFR C797S, which arises in ∼33\% of patients after osimertinib treatment, occurs in {\textless}3\% after rociletinib. Increased MET copy number is the most frequent rociletinib resistance mechanism in this cohort and patients with multiple pre-existing mechanisms (T790M and MET) experience inferior responses. Similarly, rociletinib-resistant xenografts develop MET amplification that can be overcome with the MET inhibitor crizotinib. These results underscore the importance of tumour heterogeneity in NSCLC and the utility of ctDNA-based resistance mechanism assessment.},

However, low quantities of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the blood and sequencing artifacts currently limit analytical sensitivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an approach for integrated digital error suppression (iDES). Our method combines in silico elimination of highly stereotypical background artifacts with a molecular barcoding strategy for the efficient recovery of cfDNA molecules. Individually, these two methods each improve the sensitivity of cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq) by about threefold, and synergize when combined to yield ∼15-fold improvements. As a result, iDES-enhanced CAPP-Seq facilitates noninvasive variant detection across hundreds of kilobases. Applied to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, our method enabled biopsy-free profiling of EGFR kinase domain mutations with 92\% sensitivity and {\textgreater}99.99\% specificity at the variant level, and with 90\% sensitivity and 96\% specificity at the patient level. In addition, our approach allowed monitoring of NSCLC ctDNA down to 4 in 10(5) cfDNA molecules.

In patients with curable lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the eradication of all disease is necessary for cure. In patients with incurable lymphomas, such as follicular lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma, deep and durable remissions are associated with improvements in survival. Radiographic imaging modalities such as computed tomography and positron emission tomography are the current gold standard for monitoring therapy, but they are fundamentally limited by radiation risks, costs, lack of tumor specificity, and inability to detect disease at the molecular level. Novel sequencing-based methods can detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the peripheral blood with great sensitivity, which opens new opportunities for molecular monitoring before, during, and after therapy. Beyond monitoring, ctDNA can also be used as a "liquid biopsy" to assess for molecular changes after therapy that may identify treatment-resistant clones. ctDNA is an emerging tool that may transform our ability to offer precision therapy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma.},

	abstract = {OPINION STATEMENT: The goal of therapy for aggressive B-cell lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is to achieve cure. Combination chemotherapy with rituximab cures most patients, but those with recurrent disease have a poor prognosis. Medical imaging scans such as computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are the principal methods to assess response and monitor for disease relapse after therapy but are fundamentally limited by risks of radiation, cost, and a lack of tumor specificity. Novel sequencing-based DNA monitoring methods are capable of quantifying small amounts of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) before, during, and after therapy for mature B-cell lymphomas. Detection of ctDNA encoding clonal rearranged variable-diversity-joining (VDJ) receptor gene sequences has demonstrated improved analytical sensitivity and enhanced tumor specificity compared to imaging scans in DLBCL, offering broad clinical applicability across a range of aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Molecular monitoring of ctDNA has vaulted into the spotlight as a promising non-invasive tool with immediate clinical impact on monitoring for recurrence after therapy prior to clinical symptoms. As these clinical observations are validated, ctDNA monitoring needs to be investigated as a tool for response-adapted therapy and as a marker of minimal residual disease upon completion of therapy in aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Molecular monitoring of ctDNA holds tremendous promise that may ultimately transform our ability to monitor disease in aggressive B-cell lymphomas.},

	abstract = {The Spectrin cytoskeleton is known to be polarised in epithelial cells, yet its role remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the Spectrin cytoskeleton controls Hippo signalling. In the developing Drosophila wing and eye, loss of apical Spectrins (alpha/beta‐heavy dimers) produces tissue overgrowth and mis‐regulation of Hippo target genes, similar to loss of Crumbs (Crb) or the FERM‐domain protein Expanded (Ex). Apical beta‐heavy Spectrin binds to Ex and co‐localises with it at the apical membrane to antagonise Yki activity. Interestingly, in both the ovarian follicular epithelium and intestinal epithelium of Drosophila, apical Spectrins and Crb are dispensable for repression of Yki, while basolateral Spectrins (alpha/beta dimers) are essential. Finally, the Spectrin cytoskeleton is required to regulate the localisation of the Hippo pathway effector YAP in response to cell density human epithelial cells. Our findings identify both apical and basolateral Spectrins as regulators of Hippo signalling and suggest Spectrins as potential mechanosensors.

In Drosophila, both the apical and the basolateral Spectrin cytoskeleton are able to activate the Hippo signaling pathway in a tissue‐dependent manner. In cultured human cells this depends on cell density, suggesting a role for Spectrins in mechanosensing.

	abstract = {The telltale DNA in lymphoma
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is a relatively common type of tumor that can exhibit a wide range of behaviors, from indolent and curable cancers to ones that are very aggressive and difficult to treat. By analyzing DNA in tumor samples and blood of lymphoma patients, Scherer et al. have shown that specific genetic characteristics can determine each tumor’s cell of origin and identify tumors that are going to transform into more aggressive subtypes and may require more intensive treatment. The authors also demonstrated that circulating tumor DNA in the patients’ blood is suitable for this analysis, allowing for periodic monitoring of each patient without repeated invasive biopsies.
Patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) exhibit marked diversity in tumor behavior and outcomes, yet the identification of poor-risk groups remains challenging. In addition, the biology underlying these differences is incompletely understood. We hypothesized that characterization of mutational heterogeneity and genomic evolution using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) profiling could reveal molecular determinants of adverse outcomes. To address this hypothesis, we applied cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq) analysis to tumor biopsies and cell-free DNA samples from 92 lymphoma patients and 24 healthy subjects. At diagnosis, the amount of ctDNA was found to strongly correlate with clinical indices and was independently predictive of patient outcomes. We demonstrate that ctDNA genotyping can classify transcriptionally defined tumor subtypes, including DLBCL cell of origin, directly from plasma. By simultaneously tracking multiple somatic mutations in ctDNA, our approach outperformed immunoglobulin sequencing and radiographic imaging for the detection of minimal residual disease and facilitated noninvasive identification of emergent resistance mutations to targeted therapies. In addition, we identified distinct patterns of clonal evolution distinguishing indolent follicular lymphomas from those that transformed into DLBCL, allowing for potential noninvasive prediction of histological transformation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that ctDNA analysis reveals biological factors that underlie lymphoma clinical outcomes and could facilitate individualized therapy.
Circulating tumor DNA reveals patterns of clonal evolution and allows classification of tumor subtypes in lymphoma.

	abstract = {Characterizing the complex interplay of cellular processes in cancer would enable the discovery of key mechanisms underlying its development and progression. Published approaches to decipher driver mechanisms do not explicitly model tissue-specific changes in pathway networks and the regulatory disruptions related to genomic aberrations in cancers. We therefore developed InFlo, a novel systems biology approach for characterizing complex biological processes using a unique multidimensional framework integrating transcriptomic, genomic and/or epigenomic profiles for any given cancer sample. We show that InFlo robustly characterizes tissue-specific differences in activities of signalling networks on a genome scale using unique probabilistic models of molecular interactions on a per-sample basis. Using large-scale multi-omics cancer datasets, we show that InFlo exhibits higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting pathway networks associated with specific disease states when compared to published pathway network modelling approaches. Furthermore, InFlo’s ability to infer the activity of unmeasured signalling network components was also validated using orthogonal gene expression signatures. We then evaluated multi-omics profiles of primary high-grade serous ovarian cancer tumours (N=357) to delineate mechanisms underlying resistance to frontline platinum-based chemotherapy. InFlo was the only algorithm to identify hyperactivation of the cAMP-CREB1 axis as a key mechanism associated with resistance to platinum-based therapy, a finding that we subsequently experimentally validated. We confirmed that inhibition of CREB1 phosphorylation potently sensitized resistant cells to platinum therapy and was effective in killing ovarian cancer stem cells that contribute to both platinum-resistance and tumour recurrence. Thus, we propose InFlo to be a scalable and widely applicable and robust integrative network modelling framework for the discovery of evidence-based biomarkers and therapeutic targets.},

To discover underlying brain regulatory systems, we performed a genetic screen in recombinant inbred mice for quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling glucagon secretion in response to neuroglucopenia. We identified a QTL on the distal part of chromosome 7 and combined this genetic information with transcriptomic analysis of hypothalami. This revealed Fgf15 as the strongest candidate to control the glucagon response. Fgf15 was expressed by neurons of the dorsomedial hypothalamus and the perifornical area. Intracerebroventricular injection of FGF19, the human ortholog of Fgf15, reduced activation by neuroglucopenia of dorsal vagal complex neurons, of the parasympathetic nerve, and lowered glucagon secretion. In contrast, silencing Fgf15 in the dorsomedial hypothalamus increased neuroglucopenia-induced glucagon secretion. These data identify hypothalamic Fgf15 as a regulator of glucagon secretion.},

We also conducted a survey to identify the methodological components in registered research studies which are described as 'pilot' or 'feasibility' studies. We extended this survey to grant-awarding bodies and editors of medical journals to discover their policies regarding the function and reporting of pilot studies.},

However, when the CRISPR-Cas9 system persists in the host cells, off-target effects and Cas9 cytotoxicity may occur, which might block subsequent genetic manipulation. Here, we report a method of spontaneously eliminating the CRISPR-Cas9 system without impairing its robust editing function. We successfully expressed single guide RNA under the driver of an endogenous U6 promoter and the human codon-optimized Cas9 endonuclease with an ACT1 promoter. This system can effectively generate an indel mutation and efficiently perform targeted gene disruption via homology-directed repair by electroporation in yeast. We then demonstrated the spontaneous elimination of the system via a cis arrangement of the CRISPR-Cas9 expression cassettes to the recombination construct. After a system-mediated double crossover, the CRISPR-Cas9 cassettes were cleaved and degraded, which was validated by Southern blotting. This 'suicide' CRISPR-Cas9 system enables the validation of gene functions by subsequent complementation and has the potential to minimize off-target effects. Thus, this technique has the potential for use in functional genomics studies of C. neoformans.},

New spacers are added invariably to the 5′ end of the array; therefore, the first spacer matches the latest foreign threat. Whether this highly polarized order of spacer insertion influences CRISPR-Cas immunity has not been explored. Here we show that a conserved sequence located immediately upstream of the CRISPR array specifies the site of new spacer integration. Mutation of this sequence results in erroneous incorporation of new spacers into the middle of the array. We show that spacers added through polarized acquisition give rise to more robust CRISPR-Cas immunity than spacers added to the middle of the array. This study demonstrates that the CRISPR-Cas system specifies the site of spacer integration to optimize the immune response against the most immediate threat to the host.},

	abstract = {The aberrant epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) plays a major role during carcinogenesis and regaining these dormant functions by engineering of sequence-specific epigenome editing tools offers a unique opportunity for targeted therapies. However, effectively normalizing the expression and regaining tumor suppressive functions of silenced TSGs by artificial transcription factors (ATFs) still remains a major challenge. Herein we describe novel combinatorial strategies for the potent reactivation of two class II TSGs, MASPIN and REPRIMO, in cell lines with varying epigenetic states, using the CRISPR/dCas9 associated system linked to a panel of effector domains (VP64, p300, VPR and SAM complex), as well as with protein-based ATFs, Zinc Fingers and TALEs. We found that co-delivery of multiple effector domains using a combination of CRISPR/dCas9 and TALEs or SAM complex maximized activation in highly methylated promoters. In particular, CRISPR/dCas9 VPR with SAM upregulated MASPIN mRNA (22,145-fold change) in H157 lung cancer cells, with accompanying re-expression of MASPIN protein, which led to a concomitant inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptotic cell death. Consistently, CRISPR/dCas9 VP64 with SAM upregulated REPRIMO (680-fold change), which led to phenotypic reprogramming in AGS gastric cancer cells. Altogether, our results outlined novel sequence-specific, combinatorial epigenome editing approaches to reactivate highly methylated TSGs as a promising therapy for cancer and other diseases.},

CRISPR/Cas9 system has taken the world of genome editing by storm in recent years. Its popularity as a tool for altering genomes is due to the ability of Cas9 protein to cause double-stranded breaks in DNA after binding with short guide RNA molecules, which can be produced with dramatically less effort and expense than required for production of transcription-activator like effector nucleases (TALEN) and zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN). This system has been exploited in many species from prokaryotes to higher animals including human cells as evidenced by the literature showing increasing sophistication and ease of CRISPR/Cas9 as well as increasing species variety where it is applicable. This technology is poised to solve several complex molecular biology problems faced in life science research including cancer research. In this review, we highlight the recent advancements in CRISPR/Cas9 system in editing genomes of prokaryotes, fungi, plants and animals and provide details on software tools available for convenient design of CRISPR/Cas9 targeting plasmids.

Two egg white genes, ovalbumin and ovomucoid, were efficiently ({\textgreater}90\%) mutagenized in cultured chicken primordial germ cells (PGCs) by transfection of circular plasmids encoding Cas9, a single guide RNA, and a gene encoding drug resistance, followed by transient antibiotic selection. We transplanted CRISPR-induced mutant-ovomucoid PGCs into recipient chicken embryos and established three germline chimeric roosters (G0). All of the roosters had donor-derived mutant-ovomucoid spermatozoa, and the two with a high transmission rate of donor-derived gametes produced heterozygous mutant ovomucoid chickens as about half of their donor-derived offspring in the next generation (G1). Furthermore, we generated ovomucoid homozygous mutant offspring (G2) by crossing the G1 mutant chickens. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9 system is a simple and effective gene-targeting method in chickens.},

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and the CRISPR-associated (cas) genes comprise an adaptive immune system that is one of the most widespread means by which bacteria defend themselves against phages. We identified the first examples of proteins produced by phages that inhibit a CRISPR-Cas system. Here we performed biochemical and in vivo investigations of three of these anti-CRISPR proteins, and show that each inhibits CRISPR-Cas activity through a distinct mechanism. Two block the DNA-binding activity of the CRISPR-Cas complex, yet do this by interacting with different protein subunits, and using steric or non-steric modes of inhibition. The third anti-CRISPR protein operates by binding to the Cas3 helicase-nuclease and preventing its recruitment to the DNA-bound CRISPR-Cas complex. In vivo, this anti-CRISPR can convert the CRISPR-Cas system into a transcriptional repressor, providing the first example-to our knowledge-of modulation of CRISPR-Cas activity by a protein interactor. The diverse sequences and mechanisms of action of these anti-CRISPR proteins imply an independent evolution, and foreshadow the existence of other means by which proteins may alter CRISPR-Cas function.},

We find that BMI and obesity are strongly correlated among biological parent-child pairs, but there are no significant intergenerational associations in these health traits among adoptive parent-child pairs. The intergenerational elasticity of BMI for children to their parents is 0.2 in the matched biological sample, but indistinguishable from zero for adopted children with a standard error more than three times as large as the coefficient. Under reasonable assumptions, these findings indicate that the intergenerational transmission of BMI and obesity occurs primarily through genetic mechanisms. Additional analyses of transmission rates by parental gender and among step-parents and step-children support this conclusion. The role of determinants of BMI and obesity in the household environment in relation to our findings is discussed. Given the negative consequences of obesity on earnings and other economic measures, our results suggest that the genetic transmission of weight problems contributes substantially to intergenerational persistence in economic outcomes.},

Given its important health and economic impact, the underlying genetics of its consumption has been widely studied. Despite these efforts, much has still to be uncovered. In particular, the use of non-additive genetic models may uncover new information about the genetic variants driving coffee consumption. We have conducted a genome-wide association study in two Italian populations using additive, recessive and dominant models for analysis. This has uncovered a significant association in the PDSS2 gene under the recessive model that has been replicated in an independent cohort from the Netherlands (ERF). The identified gene has been shown to negatively regulate the expression of the caffeine metabolism genes and can thus be linked to coffee consumption. Further bioinformatics analysis of eQTL and histone marks from Roadmap data has evidenced a possible role of the identified SNPs in regulating PDSS2 gene expression through enhancers present in its intron. Our results highlight a novel gene which regulates coffee consumption by regulating the expression of the genes linked to caffeine metabolism. Further studies will be needed to clarify the biological mechanism which links PDSS2 and coffee consumption.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) translate deliberate intentions and associated changes in brain activity into action, thereby offering patients with severe paralysis an alternative means of communication with and control over their environment. Such systems are not available yet, partly due to the high performance standard that is required. A major challenge in the development of implantable BCIs is to identify cortical regions and related functions that an individual can reliably and consciously manipulate. Research predominantly focuses on the sensorimotor cortex, which can be activated by imagining motor actions. However, because this region may not provide an optimal solution to all patients, other neuronal networks need to be examined. Therefore, we investigated whether the cognitive control network can be used for BCI purposes. We also determined the feasibility of using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for noninvasive localization of the cognitive control network.
METHODS: Three patients with intractable epilepsy, who were temporarily implanted with subdural grid electrodes for diagnostic purposes, attempted to gain BCI control using the electrocorticographic (ECoG) signal of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).
RESULTS: All subjects quickly gained accurate BCI control by modulation of gamma-power of the left DLPFC. Prelocalization of the relevant region was performed with fMRI and was confirmed using the ECoG signals obtained during mental calculation localizer tasks.
INTERPRETATION: The results indicate that the cognitive control network is a suitable source of signals for BCI applications. They also demonstrate the feasibility of translating understanding about cognitive networks derived from functional neuroimaging into clinical applications.},

	abstract = {The ability to learn new skills and perfect them with practice applies not only to physical skills but also to abstract skills, like motor planning or neuroprosthetic actions. Although plasticity in corticostriatal circuits has been implicated in learning physical skills, it remains unclear if similar circuits or processes are required for abstract skill learning. Here we use a novel behavioural task in rodents to investigate the role of corticostriatal plasticity in abstract skill learning. Rodents learned to control the pitch of an auditory cursor to reach one of two targets by modulating activity in primary motor cortex irrespective of physical movement. Degradation of the relation between action and outcome, as well as sensory-specific devaluation and omission tests, demonstrate that these learned neuroprosthetic actions are intentional and goal-directed, rather than habitual. Striatal neurons change their activity with learning, with more neurons modulating their activity in relation to target-reaching as learning progresses. Concomitantly, strong relations between the activity of neurons in motor cortex and the striatum emerge. Specific deletion of striatal NMDA receptors impairs the development of this corticostriatal plasticity, and disrupts the ability to learn neuroprosthetic skills. These results suggest that corticostriatal plasticity is necessary for abstract skill learning, and that neuroprosthetic movements capitalize on the neural circuitry involved in natural motor learning.},

Seven subjects were implanted with electrocorticography (ECoG) electrodes and had multiple opportunities to practice a 1D BCI task. As subjects became proficient, strong initial task-related activation was followed by lessening of activation in prefrontal cortex, premotor cortex, and posterior parietal cortex, areas that have previously been implicated in the cognitive phase of motor sequence learning and abstract task learning. These results demonstrate that, although the use of a BCI only requires modulation of a local population of neurons, a distributed network of cortical areas is involved in the acquisition of BCI proficiency.},

Neuroprosthetic control has been associated with tuning changes in specific neurons directly projecting to the BMI (hereafter referred to as direct neurons). However, little is known about the larger network dynamics. By monitoring ensembles of neurons that were either causally linked to BMI control or indirectly involved, we found that proficient neuroprosthetic control is associated with large-scale modifications to the cortical network in macaque monkeys. Specifically, there were changes in the preferred direction of both direct and indirect neurons. Notably, with learning, there was a relative decrease in the net modulation of indirect neural activity in comparison with direct activity. These widespread differential changes in the direct and indirect population activity were markedly stable from one day to the next and readily coexisted with the long-standing cortical network for upper limb control. Thus, the process of learning BMI control is associated with differential modification of neural populations based on their specific relation to movement control.},

It remains unclear whether a stable cortical representation for prosthetic function can be stored and recalled in a manner that mimics our natural recall of motor skills. Especially in light of the mixed evidence for a stationary neuron-behavior relationship in cortical motor areas, understanding this relationship during long-term neuroprosthetic control can elucidate principles of neural plasticity as well as improve prosthetic function. Here, we paired stable recordings from ensembles of primary motor cortex neurons in macaque monkeys with a constant decoder that transforms neural activity to prosthetic movements. Proficient control was closely linked to the emergence of a surprisingly stable pattern of ensemble activity, indicating that the motor cortex can consolidate a neural representation for prosthetic control in the presence of a constant decoder. The importance of such a cortical map was evident in that small perturbations to either the size of the neural ensemble or to the decoder could reversibly disrupt function. Moreover, once a cortical map became consolidated, a second map could be learned and stored. Thus, long-term use of a neuroprosthetic device is associated with the formation of a cortical map for prosthetic function that is stable across time, readily recalled, resistant to interference, and resembles a putative memory engram.},

	abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have traditionally been developed for paralyzed and locked-in individuals with no motor control. However, there is a much larger population of patients with some residual motor function as well as the general population of able-bodied individuals, both of whom could benefit significantly from BCIs. An important question that has yet to be systematically studied is: can subjects use BCIs simultaneously with overt motor activity? We present results from a preliminary study aimed at exploring this question. Three subjects used hand motor imagery in an electroencephalographic (EEG) BCI while simultaneously using a joystick to control a cursor. Particular attention was paid to preventing potential muscle artifacts from influencing imagery-based control. All three subjects were able to use the hybrid "imagery+joystick" mode of control over two days, demonstrating the ability to learn and significantly improve performance. These results suggest that subjects can potentially augment their normal human sensorimotor capability by exercising direct brain control over devices concurrently with overt motor control.},

	abstract = {Human sensory and motor systems provide the natural means for the exchange of information between individuals, and, hence, the basis for human civilization. The recent development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) has provided an important element for the creation of brain-to-brain communication systems, and precise brain stimulation techniques are now available for the realization of non-invasive computer-brain interfaces (CBI). These technologies, BCI and CBI, can be combined to realize the vision of non-invasive, computer-mediated brain-to-brain (B2B) communication between subjects (hyperinteraction). Here we demonstrate the conscious transmission of information between human brains through the intact scalp and without intervention of motor or peripheral sensory systems. Pseudo-random binary streams encoding words were transmitted between the minds of emitter and receiver subjects separated by great distances, representing the realization of the first human brain-to-brain interface. In a series of experiments, we established internet-mediated B2B communication by combining a BCI based on voluntary motor imagery-controlled electroencephalographic (EEG) changes with a CBI inducing the conscious perception of phosphenes (light flashes) through neuronavigated, robotized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), with special care taken to block sensory (tactile, visual or auditory) cues. Our results provide a critical proof-of-principle demonstration for the development of conscious B2B communication technologies. More fully developed, related implementations will open new research venues in cognitive, social and clinical neuroscience and the scientific study of consciousness. We envision that hyperinteraction technologies will eventually have a profound impact on the social structure of our civilization and raise important ethical issues.},

Rats readily learn to use this new information source, and generate active exploratory strategies to discriminate among infrared signals in their environment. S1 neurons in these infrared-perceiving rats respond to both whisker deflection and intracortical microstimulation, suggesting that the infrared representation does not displace the original tactile representation. Hence, sensory cortical prostheses, in addition to restoring normal neurological functions, may serve to expand natural perceptual capabilities in mammals.},

The differential gamma-band amplitude (75-105 Hz) from two arbitrarily chosen 300 μm electrodes (one located over each cortical area) was used for closed-loop control of a one-dimensional BCI device. Each monkey rapidly learned over a period of days to successfully control the velocity of a computer cursor. While both cortical areas contributed to success on the BCI task, the control signals from M1 were consistently modulated more strongly than those from PMd. Additionally, we observe that gamma-band power during active BCI control is always above resting brain activity. This suggests that purposeful gamma-band modulation is an active process that is obtained through increased cortical activation.},

These two characteristics defy the classical object-observer duality, making BMIs particularly appealing for investigating how information is encoded and decoded by neural circuits in real time, how this coding changes with physiological learning and plasticity, and how it is altered in pathological conditions. Within neuroengineering, BMI is like a tree that opens its branches into many traditional engineering fields, but also extends deep roots into basic neuroscience beyond neuroprosthetics.},

	shorttitle = {Strength increases from the motor program},
	abstract = {1. This study addressed potential neural mechanisms of the strength increase that occur before muscle hypertrophy. In particular we examined whether such strength increases may result from training-induced changes in voluntary motor programs. We compared the maximal voluntary force production after a training program of repetitive maximal isometric muscle contractions with force output after a training program that did not involve repetitive activation of muscle; that is, after mental training. 2. Subjects trained their left hypothenar muscles for 4 wk, five sessions per week. One group produced repeated maximal isometric contractions of the abductor muscles of the fifth digit's metacarpophalangeal joint. A second group imagined producing these same, effortful isometric contractions. A third group did not train their fifth digit. Maximal abduction force, flexion/extension force and electrically evoked twitch force (abduction) of the fifth digit were measured along with maximal integrated electromyograms (EMG) of the hypothenar muscles from both hands before and after training. 3. Average abduction force of the left fifth digit increased 22\% for the Imagining group and 30\% for the Contraction group. The mean increase for the Control group was 3.7\%. 4. The maximal abduction force of the right (untrained) fifth digit increased significantly in both the Imagining and Contraction groups after training (10 and 14\%, respectively), but not in the Control group (2.3\%). These results are consistent with previous studies of training effects on contralateral limbs. 5. The abduction twitch force evoked by supramaximal electrical stimulations of the ulnar nerve was unchanged in all three groups after training, consistent with an absence of muscle hypertrophy. The maximal force of the left great toe extensors for individual subjects remained unchanged after training, which argues against strength increases due to general increases in effort level. 6. Increases in abduction and flexion forces of the fifth digit were poorly correlated in subjects of both training groups. The fifth finger abduction force and the hypothenar integrated EMG increases were not well correlated in these subjects either. Together these results indicate that training-induced changes of synergist and antagonist muscle activation patterns may have contributed to force increases in some of the subjects. 7. Strength increases can be achieved without repeated muscle activation. These force gains appear to result from practice effects on central motor programming/planning. The results of these experiments add to existing evidence for the neural origin of strength increases that occur before muscle hypertrophy.},

We mapped the cortical motor areas targeting the contralateral long finger flexor and extensor muscles in subjects learning a one-handed, five-finger exercise on the piano. In a second experiment, we studied the different effects of mental and physical practice of the same five-finger exercise on the modulation of the cortical motor areas targeting muscles involved in the task. 2. Over the course of 5 days, as subjects learned the one-handed, five-finger exercise through daily 2-h manual practice sessions, the cortical motor areas targeting the long finger flexor and extensor muscles enlarged, and their activation threshold decreased. Such changes were limited to the cortical representation of the hand used in the exercise. No changes of cortical motor outputs occurred in control subjects who underwent daily TMS mapping but did not practice on the piano at all (control group 1). 3. We studied the effect of increased hand use without specific skill learning in subjects who played the piano at will for 2 h each day using only the right hand but who were not taught the five-finger exercise (control group 2) and who did not practice any specific task. In these control subjects, the changes in cortical motor outputs were similar but significantly less prominent than in those occurring in the test subjects, who learned the new skill.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Yet, no study in animals or in human subjects has indicated that long-term BMI training could induce any type of clinical recovery. Eight chronic (3-13 years) spinal cord injury (SCI) paraplegics were subjected to long-term training (12 months) with a multi-stage BMI-based gait neurorehabilitation paradigm aimed at restoring locomotion. This paradigm combined intense immersive virtual reality training, enriched visual-tactile feedback, and walking with two EEG-controlled robotic actuators, including a custom-designed lower limb exoskeleton capable of delivering tactile feedback to subjects. Following 12 months of training with this paradigm, all eight patients experienced neurological improvements in somatic sensation (pain localization, fine/crude touch, and proprioceptive sensing) in multiple dermatomes. Patients also regained voluntary motor control in key muscles below the SCI level, as measured by EMGs, resulting in marked improvement in their walking index. As a result, 50\% of these patients were upgraded to an incomplete paraplegia classification. Neurological recovery was paralleled by the reemergence of lower limb motor imagery at cortical level. We hypothesize that this unprecedented neurological recovery results from both cortical and spinal cord plasticity triggered by long-term BMI usage.},

同一时间，有两项研究（1） 表明：我们可以像进行体育锻炼一样对我们的大脑进行训练，对大脑进行心智训练可以增强现有的突触，并创造新的突触。这些研究成果支持了现代神经科学家、 1906年诺贝尔生理学或医学奖得主圣地亚哥·拉蒙-卡哈尔（Santiago Ramón y Cajal）曾说过的话：「每个人都可以是他自己大脑的雕塑家 。」而雕塑的秘诀，就是对大脑进行心智训练。当时，卡哈尔并不能证明他的理论，但是一个世纪过去后，神经可塑性研究支持了他的观点，而这也成为 Nicolelis研究大脑控制仿生外骨骼的理论基石。
 
1999年，他制造出了第一台脑机接口装置–脑机接口装置读取神经元组的信号并将其转换成机器指令，这类似于一个健全人的大脑发送信号到脊髓，然后传送到肌肉。第一次成功展示脑机接口装置时，Nicolelis研究出一种可以读取小鼠「推动杠杆去获取水」的大脑活动的传感器。小鼠只要想象去推动杠杆的活动，脑机接口便会将这个信号转变为命令，并发送杠杆那里，这样小鼠就能获得水。
 
2004年，首次进行了脑机接口的人体实验，该实验涉及11名准备接受深脑刺激的帕金森患者，Nicolelis获得了在深脑刺激过程中往这些帕金森患者 脑中植入传感器的许可。Nicolelis让患者玩视频游戏，然后连接了脑机接口，帕金森患者学会如何利用他们的思维来控制游戏。
 
2008年，就在巴西成功申请世界杯举办权的几个月后，Nicolelis的团队进行了最著名的实验。他们在一只叫做Idoya的成年雌性猕猴的大脑里植 入了一次可以读取250-300个神经元的电极，Idoya在杜克大学的实验室里的跑步机上走动，同时在日本，一个约200重，5英尺高的人形机器人接收 着来自Idoya的脑信号。
很快，机器人开始移动。在这个过程中，唯一让机器人移动的指令源自Idoya这只猴子的大脑。跑步机上安装了一个屏幕，Idoya可以屏幕上看到远在日本 的机器人。更令人震惊的是，远在日本的机器人接收来自Idoya大脑命令的速度甚至超过了Idoya自己双腿接受命令的速度！后来，当Idoya停止走动 但是它的大脑仍然在想着「走路」时，机器人仍然在走动。
 
在2011年，Nicolelis找到了解决方法，他发现大脑解码来自机械传感器的信号和解码来自身体自身感受器的信号一样容易，这些信号可以直接发送给 大脑，也可以借助其他神经和感受器来传递。「这就像是创造了一个第六种感觉」，Nicolelis说，「在特定的条件下传递信号，大脑可以非常快地学习如 何处理这种新型的人工信息，这样我们就能创造出一个『人工触感』」。Nicolelis认为这种「第六种感觉」可以让脊髓损伤患者体验到他们的脚接触地面 的感觉。
 
2011年6月，Nicolelis认为自己应该进行「再次行走」计划（Walk Again Project）。

Aberrant centromere and kinetochore function causes CIN through chromosome missegregation, leading to aneuploidy, rearrangements and micronucleus formation. Here we develop a Centromere and kinetochore gene Expression Score (CES) signature that quantifies the centromere and kinetochore gene misexpression in cancers. High CES values correlate with increased levels of genomic instability and several specific adverse tumour properties, and prognosticate poor patient survival for breast and lung cancers, especially early-stage tumours. They also signify high levels of genomic instability that sensitize cancer cells to additional genotoxicity. Thus, the CES signature forecasts patient response to adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Our results demonstrate the prognostic and predictive power of the CES, suggest a role for centromere misregulation in cancer progression, and support the idea that tumours with extremely high CIN are less tolerant to specific genotoxic therapies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine factors influencing separation and infectious type wound complications (WCs) in morbidly obese women undergoing primary cesarean delivery (CD).
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study evaluating infectious and separation WC in morbidly obese (body mass index [BMI] {\textgreater} 35 kg/m(2)) women undergoing primary CD between January 1994 and December 2008. Chi-square, Fisher's exact and Student's t tests used to assess associated factors; backward logistic regression to determine unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios.
RESULTS: Of 623 women, low transverse skin incisions were performed in 588 (94.4\%), vertical in 35 (7\%). Overall WC rate was 13.5\%, which varied by incision type (vertical 45.7\% vs. 11.6\% transverse; p {\textless} 0.01), but not BMI class. Incision type and unscheduled CD were associated with infection risk, while incision type, BMI, race and drain use were associated with wound separation.
CONCLUSION: In morbidly obese women both infectious and separation type WC are more common in vertical than low transverse incisions; therefore transverse should be preferred.},

METHODS: 164 women divided into two groups: 70 with subcutaneous tissue thickness of at least 2 cm and 94 with subcutaneous tissue thickness more than 2 cm. These groups were randomized to closure of the subcutaneous fat tissue or no closure with cesarean delivery.
RESULTS: In the 68 women with subcutaneous tissue thickness of at least 2 cm who completed the study, there was no difference between closure and no closure subgroups in terms of incidence of wound disruption. In 91 women with subcutaneous tissue thickness more than 2 cm who completed the study, the incidence of wound disruption was significantly higher in the no closure subgroup. In the no closure subgroup of 91 women with subcutaneous fat thickness more than 2 cm, the incidence of wound disruption was significantly higher than that of the 68 women with subcutaneous tissue thickness at least 2 cm.
CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous tissue approximation with absorbable suture at closure of the abdominal incision during cesarean delivery appears to reduce the rate of postoperative wound disruption in patients with more than 2 cm of subcutaneous tissue.},

	abstract = {In many countries caesarean section has become the mode of delivery in over a quarter of all births. Safety of the mother and cost are the two main areas of concern. Various studies on the techniques of performing a caesarean section have focused on reducing the operating time, blood loss, wound infection and cost. Given the fact that caesarean section is the most commonly performed operation in obstetrics, it is important that trainers and trainees are familiar with the basic surgical techniques and that best practice is followed. At the same time surgeons should take necessary precautions to reduce their risk of exposure to Hepatitis B and HIV. The skin incision and entry into abdominal cavity is best achieved by the modified Cohen's incision. The lower segment transverse uterine incision has stood the test of time over a period of 75 years and remains the best way to enter the uterus. Closure of the uterus in single layer appears to be acceptable, whenever technically possible. Placental delivery should be by controlled cord traction after spontaneous expulsion. Closure of the visceral and parietal layers of the peritoneum no longer seems to be necessary. Obliteration of space in the subcutaneous layer, either by suture or by suction, seems to reduce wound disruption. These issues are being considered in the CAESAR randomized controlled trial of surgical techniques currently underway in England.Prophylactic antibiotics are mandatory in preventing post-operative morbidity. Many of the above mentioned steps have been tested in randomized trials. Further studies are needed to examine a wide range of questions arising from this review, e.g. best position of the patient, the value of exteriorization of the uterus whilst repairing the uterus, and the use of agents to relax the uterus in difficult deliveries.},

	abstract = {研究背景
高龄经产妇是指到达预产期时年龄满35周岁的经产妇。由于“单独二孩”政策的全面开放、离婚率和再婚率增高、经产妇子女因病或者意外事故死亡而再次生育等原因,中国孕产妇中高龄经产妇所占的比例不断上升。高龄经产妇随着年龄的增高、妊娠次数的增加,妊娠合并症、并发症及不良妊娠结局的发生率可能明显增加,尤其是流产、早产、及胎儿发育异常风险明显增加。同时,高龄经产妇本次分娩距前次分娩间隔时间较长、再次分娩新生儿体重常高于初产妇、疤痕子宫所占比例高,故难产率增加。
高龄女性再次生育将会带来新的挑战,因此进一步了解高龄妇女再次妊娠对母儿的影响,分析其孕产期合并症、并发症及围产儿结局情况,对提高高龄经产妇围产保健水平、避免母儿并发症及不良妊娠结局有着十分重要的意义。
研究目的
了解高龄经产妇、高龄初产妇、非高龄经产妇三组孕产妇在妊娠合并症及并发症、围生儿结局及分娩方式方面的差异,提出高龄经产妇孕产期管理的针对性意见,指导高龄经产妇孕产期管理,改善妊娠结局。
研究方法
选择2013年1月1日至2013年12月31日在浙江大学医学院附属妇产科医院住院分娩的产妇作为研究对象,分为高龄经产妇、高龄初产妇、非高龄经产妇三组,对其一般情况、既往分娩情况、妊娠合并症及并发症、分娩方式、难产因素及新生儿结局进行回顾性分析,比较不同组别孕产妇在妊娠合并症及并发症、围生儿结局及分娩情况方面的差异。
研究结果
1、妊娠合并症与并发症：
(1)妊娠期高血压疾病：高龄经产妇组低于高龄初产妇组(P{\textless}0.01),高于非高龄经产妇组(P{\textless}0.01)。
(2)妊娠期糖尿病：高龄经产妇组高于非高龄经产妇组(P{\textless}0.01),与高龄初产妇组无统计学差异(P{\textgreater}0.05)。
(3)前置胎盘：高龄经产妇组高于高龄初产妇组(P{\textless}0.05),与非高龄经产妇组无统计学差异(P{\textgreater}0.05)；胎盘粘连：高龄经产妇组高于高龄初产妇组与非高龄经产妇组(P{\textless}0.05)。
(4)胎膜早破：高龄经产妇组高于非高龄经产妇组(P{\textless}0.05),与高龄初产妇组无统计学差异(P{\textgreater}0.05)。
(5)子宫肌瘤：高龄经产妇组高于高龄初产妇组(P{\textless}0.05)及非高龄经产妇组(P{\textless}0.01)。
2、流产、早产发生率：
高龄经产妇组流产发生率与高龄初产妇组及非高龄经产妇组无明显统计学差异(P{\textgreater}0.05)；高龄经产妇组早产发生率高于非高龄经产妇组(P{\textless}0.05),与高龄初产妇组相比差异无统计学意义(P{\textgreater}0.05)。
3、围生儿结局方面：
(1)巨大儿：高龄经产妇组高于高龄初产妇组及非高龄经产妇组(P{\textless}0.05)。
(2)FGR：高龄经产妇组高于非高龄经产妇组(P{\textless}0.05),与高龄初产妇组无统计学差异(P{\textgreater}0.05)。
4、分娩方式方面：
剖宫产率：高龄经产妇组明显高于非高龄经产妇组(P{\textless}0.01),但与高龄初产妇组无差异(P{\textgreater}0.05)。
5、前次分娩距本次分娩时间(LDT)与分娩方式：
(1)剖宫产率、阴道分娩率及产钳助产率：三组无统计学差异(P{\textgreater}0.05)。
(2)阴道分娩失败中转剖官产率：LDT≥10年者高于LDT5-10年、LDT{\textless}5年(P{\textless}0.05)。
6、剖宫产指征：
(1)高龄经产妇组前四位手术指征依次为：疤痕子宫、妊娠合并症及并发症、社会因素、胎儿窘迫。
(2)高龄初产妇组前四位手术指征依次为：社会因素、妊娠合并症及并发症、胎儿窘迫、胎位异常。
(3)非高龄经产妇组前四位手术指征依次为：疤痕子宫、妊娠合并症及并发症、胎位异常、社会因素。
结论
1、高龄经产妇与高龄初产妇相比,HDCP发生率较低,而前置胎盘、胎盘粘连、子宫肌瘤发生率增加；高龄经产妇与非高龄经产妇相比,HDCP、GDM、PROM发生率增加。应重视筛查,警惕其不良并发症的发生。
2、高龄经产妇流产发生率数值均高于高龄初产妇及非高龄经产妇,但无明显统计学差异,需加大样本量进一步研究。
3、高龄经产妇早产、巨大儿、FGR发生率高,应加强对高龄经产妇的孕期保健工作,及早发现胎儿异常。
4、高龄经产妇组剖宫产率高于非高龄经产妇组,疤痕子宫为高龄经产妇组的首位指征；高龄初产妇组首位剖宫产指征为社会因素。对于疤痕子宫再次妊娠的高龄经产妇需重视阴道分娩相关指征的评估与研究,以减少剖官产率。
5、高龄经产妇前次分娩间隔时间(LDT)较长(≥10年),而LDT≥10年组阴道分娩失败中转剖宫产率高,故对高龄经产妇,应加强产程管理。},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The single most important risk factor for postpartum maternal infection is cesarean section. Although guidelines endorse the use of prophylactic antibiotics for women undergoing cesarean section, there is not uniform implementation of this recommendation. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 1995 and last updated in 2010.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of prophylactic antibiotics compared with no prophylactic antibiotics on infectious complications in women undergoing cesarean section.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 July 2014) and reference lists of retrieved papers.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing the effects of prophylactic antibiotics versus no treatment in women undergoing cesarean section.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and carried out data extraction. The clinically important primary outcomes were wound infection, endometritis, serious maternal infectious complications and adverse effects on the infant. We presented dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR), with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) and combined trials in meta-analyses. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.
MAIN RESULTS: We identified 95 studies enrolling over 15,000 women. Compared with placebo or no treatment, the use of prophylactic antibiotics in women undergoing cesarean section reduced the incidence of wound infection (RR 0.40, 95\% CI 0.35 to 0.46, 82 studies, 14,407 women), endometritis (RR 0.38, 95\% CI 0.34 to 0.42, 83 studies, 13,548 women) and maternal serious infectious complications (RR 0.31, 95\% CI 0.20 to 0.49, 32 studies, 6159 women). When only studies that included women undergoing an elective cesarean section were analyzed, there was also a reduction in the incidence of wound infections (RR 0.62, 95\% CI 0.47 to 0.82, 17 studies, 3537 women) and endometritis (RR 0.38, 95\% CI 0.24 to 0.61, 15 studies, 2502 women) with prophylactic antibiotics. Similar estimates of effect were seen whether the antibiotics were administered before the cord was clamped or after. The effect of different antibiotic regimens was studied and similar reductions in the incidence of infections were seen for most of the antibiotics and combinations.There were no data on which to estimate the effect of maternal administration of antibiotics on infant outcomes. No studies systematically collected and reported on adverse infant outcomes nor the effect of antibiotics on the developing infant immune system. No studies reported on the incidence of oral candidiasis (thrush) in babies. Maternal adverse effects were also rarely described.We judged the evidence for antibiotic treatment compared with no treatment to be of moderate quality; most studies lacked an adequate description of methods and were assessed as being at unclear risk of bias.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The conclusions of this review support the recommendation that prophylactic antibiotics should be routinely administered to all women undergoing cesarean section to prevent infection. Compared with placebo or no treatment, the use of prophylactic antibiotics in women undergoing cesarean section reduced the incidence of wound infection, endometritis and serious infectious complications by 60\% to 70\%. There were few data on adverse effects and no information on the effect of antibiotics on the baby, making the assessment of overall benefits and harms difficult. Prophylactic antibiotics given to all women undergoing elective or non-elective cesarean section is beneficial for women but there is uncertainty about the consequences for the baby.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prophylactic antibiotics for cesarean section have been shown to reduce the incidence of maternal postoperative infectious morbidity. Many different antibiotic regimens have been reported to be effective.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to determine which antibiotic regimen is most effective in reducing the incidence of infectious morbidity in women undergoing cesarean section.
SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The date of the most recent search was October 1998.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized trials that included women undergoing cesarean section were included. Trials were required to compare at least two different antibiotic regimens. Trials that compared placebo with a single antibiotic regimen were not included as these are studies which have been analyzed in another Cochrane review.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted from each publication independently by the reviewers. Reviewers were not blinded to the authors or sources of the articles. The primary outcome variable was endometritis but data on other infectious complications were collected where provided.
MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-one trials published between 1979 and 1994 were included in the review and four were excluded from the review. The following results refer to reductions in the incidence of endometritis. Both ampicillin and first generation cephalosporins have similar efficacy with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.27 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.84-1.93). In comparing ampicillin with second or third generation cephalosporins the odds ratio was 0.83 (95\% CI 0.54-1.26) and in comparing a first generation cephalosporin with a second or third generation agent the odds ratio was 1.21 (95\% CI 0.97-1.51). A multiple dose regimen for prophylaxis appears to offer no added benefit over a single dose regimen; OR 0.92 (95\% CI 0.70-1.23). Systemic and lavage routes of administration appear to have no difference in effect; OR 1.19 (95\% CI 0.81-1.73). There was no significant heterogeneity between the trials contained in the various sub-group analyses, although confidence intervals were sometimes wide.
REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Both ampicillin and first generation cephalosporins have similar efficacy in reducing postoperative endometritis. There does not appear to be added benefit in utilizing a more broad spectrum agent or a multiple dose regimen. There is a need for an appropriately designed randomized trial to test the optimal timing of administration (immediately after the cord is clamped versus pre-operative).},

It is important to understand the unique advantages and caveats of the two methods in solving structures and to appreciate the complementary nature of the two methods in structural biology.

Recent innovations in both hardware and software have made cryo-EM a viable alternative for targets that are not amenable to x-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Cryo-EM has even become the method of choice in some situations where x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy are possible but where cryo-EM can determine structures at higher resolution or with less time or effort. Rotary adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) are crucial to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. These enzymes couple the synthesis or hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate to the use or production of a transmembrane electrochemical ion gradient, respectively. However, the membrane-embedded nature and conformational heterogeneity of intact rotary ATPases have prevented their high-resolution structural analysis to date. Recent application of cryo-EM methods to the different types of rotary ATPase has led to sudden advances in understanding the structure and function of these enzymes, revealing significant conformational heterogeneity and characteristic transmembrane α helices that are highly tilted with respect to the membrane. In this Review, we will discuss what has been learned recently about rotary ATPase structure and function, with a particular focus on the vacuolar-type ATPases.},

By combining stochastic super-resolution microscopy, to directly resolve the ringlike structure of the NPC, with single particle averaging, to use information from thousands of pores, we determined the average positions of fluorescent molecular labels in the NPC with a precision well below 1 nanometer. Applying this approach systematically to the largest building block of the NPC, the Nup107-160 subcomplex, we assessed the structure of the NPC scaffold.

All core promoter elements are contacted by subunits of TFIID, with TAF1 and TAF2 mediating major interactions with the downstream promoter. TFIIA bridges the TBP-TATA complex with lobe B of TFIID. We also present the cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of a fully assembled human TAF-less PIC. Superposition of common elements between the two structures provides novel insights into the general role of TFIID in promoter recognition, PIC assembly, and transcription initiation.},

Valosin-containing protein-like ATPase of Thermoplasma acidophilum (VAT), the archaeal homolog of the ubiquitous AAA+ protein Cdc48/p97, functions in concert with the 20S proteasome by unfolding substrates and passing them on for degradation. Here, we present electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) maps showing that VAT undergoes large conformational rearrangements during its ATP hydrolysis cycle that differ dramatically from the conformational states observed for Cdc48/p97. We validate key features of the model with biochemical and solution methyl-transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopY (TROSY) NMR experiments and suggest a mechanism for coupling the energy of nucleotide hydrolysis to substrate unfolding. These findings illustrate the unique complementarity between cryo-EM and solution NMR for studies of molecular machines, showing that the structural properties of VAT, as well as the population distributions of conformers, are similar in the frozen specimens used for cryo-EM and in the solution phase where NMR spectra are recorded.},

	abstract = {Eukaryotic vacuolar H(+)-ATPases (V-ATPases) are rotary enzymes that use energy from hydrolysis of ATP to ADP to pump protons across membranes and control the pH of many intracellular compartments. ATP hydrolysis in the soluble catalytic region of the enzyme is coupled to proton translocation through the membrane-bound region by rotation of a central rotor subcomplex, with peripheral stalks preventing the entire membrane-bound region from turning with the rotor. The eukaryotic V-ATPase is the most complex rotary ATPase: it has three peripheral stalks, a hetero-oligomeric proton-conducting proteolipid ring, several subunits not found in other rotary ATPases, and is regulated by reversible dissociation of its catalytic and proton-conducting regions. Studies of ATP synthases, V-ATPases, and bacterial/archaeal V/A-ATPases have suggested that flexibility is necessary for the catalytic mechanism of rotary ATPases, but the structures of different rotational states have never been observed experimentally. Here we use electron cryomicroscopy to obtain structures for three rotational states of the V-ATPase from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The resulting series of structures shows ten proteolipid subunits in the c-ring, setting the ATP:H(+) ratio for proton pumping by the V-ATPase at 3:10, and reveals long and highly tilted transmembrane α-helices in the a-subunit that interact with the c-ring. The three different maps reveal the conformational changes that occur to couple rotation in the symmetry-mismatched soluble catalytic region to the membrane-bound proton-translocating region. Almost all of the subunits of the enzyme undergo conformational changes during the transitions between these three rotational states. The structures of these states provide direct evidence that deformation during rotation enables the smooth transmission of power through rotary ATPases.},

These protein-DNA interactions, in turn, position the HNH nuclease domain adjacent to the target DNA strand cleavage site in a conformation essential for concerted DNA cutting.

The resulting model of the PIC confirmed the main conclusions from previous cryo-EM at lower resolution, including the association of promoter DNA only with general transcription factors and not with the polymerase. Electron density due to DNA was identifiable by the grooves of the double helix and exhibited sharp bends at points downstream of the TATA box, with an important consequence: The DNA at the downstream end coincides with the DNA in a transcribing polymerase. The structure of the PIC is therefore conducive to promoter melting, start-site scanning, and the initiation of transcription.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12984-015-0064-y},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Earlier versions of biofeedback systems for balance-related applications were intended primarily to provide "alarm" signals about body tilt rather than to guide rehabilitation exercise motion. Additionally, there have been few attempts to evaluate guidance modalities for balance rehabilitation exercises. The purpose of this proof-of-concept study is to evaluate the effects of guidance modalities during common dynamic weight-shifting exercises used in clinical settings.
METHODS: A motion guidance system providing visual biofeedback, vibrotactile biofeedback, or both, was used during weight-shifting exercises. Eleven people with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and nine healthy elderly people participated. Each participant wore a six-degree-of-freedom inertial measurement unit (IMU) located near the sacrum and four linear vibrating actuators (Tactors) attached to the skin over the front, back, and right and left sides of the abdomen. The IMU measured angular displacements and velocities of body tilt in anterior-posterior (A/P) and medial-lateral (M/L) directions. Participants were instructed to follow a slow moving target by shifting their weight in either the A/P or M/L direction up to 90 \% of their limits of stability (LOS). Real-time position error was provided to participants in one of three sensory modalities: visual, vibrotactile, or both. Participants performed 5 trials for each biofeedback modality and movement direction (A/P and M/L) for a total of 30 trials in a random order. To characterize performance, position error was defined as the average absolute difference between the target and participant movements in degrees.
RESULTS: Simultaneous delivery of visual and vibrotactile biofeedback resulted in significantly lower position error compared to either visual or vibrotactile biofeedback alone regardless of the movement direction for both participant cohorts. The pairwise comparisons were not significantly different between visual and vibrotactile biofeedback.
CONCLUSION: The study is the first attempt to assess the effects of guidance modalities on common balance rehabilitation exercises in people with PD and healthy elderly people. The results suggest that combined visual and vibrotactile biofeedback can improve volitional responses during postural tracking tasks.

【龙哥很生气后果很严重 第19手开始屠龙你信吗？】
来源：搜狐体育
　　11月4日，第20届三星保险杯世界围棋大师赛半决赛三番棋第二局在韩国战罢，柯洁完胜李世石2-0晋级决赛之后，时越经过几次长考屠龙大胜唐韦星，把总比分扳成1-1平。此局时越从第19手就谋划屠龙居然得手，可谓围棋史上匪夷所思的一局。
　　三星杯半决赛三番棋，刚登上中国等级分第一宝座不久的柯洁，面对世界棋坛80后第一人、肯定会载入史册的宗师级的李世石，连续两局都行云流水般 获胜，首次晋级决赛。而前等级分第一时越，首局比赛显得急躁，序盘在大雪崩定式中为了吃子留下个负担很重的劫，最终明知劣势也不得不消劫，然后完败。而第 二局比赛，执黑的时越从第19手就谋划着屠对手的大龙，观战的棋迷还不甚了解其意图，而在野狐网讲解的黄云嵩则惊呼“如果说19靠白棋就死了的话我反正是 不信的”，但是局后他不得不说“不过确实不知道怎么才能活”。
　　从第19手就谋划着屠龙并且得手，四千年围棋史上闻所未闻，虽然从等级分第一的宝座暂时跌落，但“龙哥”时越依然是“场均一条龙”，而且屠龙方式更为直接和快捷！
　　首局执白告负的时越此局执黑先行，至黑17是流行布局。唐韦星的白18打入似乎改为在黑棋拆三处打入更为自然、常见，不过实战也未尝不可，网络 上讲解的职业棋手给出的对策是整体攻击，没人有全歼来敌的思路，当然除了时越。当时越亮出黑19以下的招法时，芈昱廷、黄云嵩等棋手以疑惑的口气说“不会 想杀吧……”嗯，确实是要杀，而且想法很明确、实施很坚决！
　　白26之后，黄云嵩说：“讲道理的话是不会死的”，他认为强杀的话黑方自身也有问题，反而可能引火烧身。然而昨天告负的龙哥，今天真的很生气， 因为第18届三星杯半决赛他就在先胜一局的情况下被唐韦星2-1逆转，在他状态正佳的时段没能冲出“世界冠军一冠群”。而生气的龙哥想让屠龙来得更早些更 猛烈些……
　　至黑39手，黄云嵩说：“黑棋的下法吓的我说不出话了”。黄云嵩何许人也？安徽芜湖籍的17岁棋手，最新的中国等级分第17位，是10月份进步最大的棋手，而在韩国棋院公布的10月份最新世界排名，黄云嵩已经高居第十位，力压多位中韩世界冠军。
　　不管别人如何评说，龙哥依然倔强前行。黑49以下坚决破眼，不管你的“刀把五”气有多长，不管我自身活没活，反正，我不让你活！
　　接下来的进行，连时越的粉丝都看出黑方可以选择局部双活了，这绝对是黑方可接受的结果。然而，但是，居然，倔强的龙哥继续倔强着……
　　时越继续选择一战定胜负的极端下法，并且局部将出现劫争越来越清晰，渐渐的，观战棋手说，“白棋要玩完……”
　　黑89之后，很多业余高手也看出来了，虽然白棋多达9气，但是黑棋可以延出更多的气。实战验证，黑方快一气杀白，从第19手就露骨地屠龙的骇人 构思，居然真的在同为世界冠军的高手面前实现了……不管决胜局结果如何，我们只能献上我们的膝盖，然后对时越说：“谢谢龙哥，为我们献上如此非凡的屠龙 谱！”

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of OSAS in patients with NAION and risk factors of second eye involvement.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, we examined 118 patients with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy referred to a tertiary care center from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2010.
EXPOSURES: Patients underwent polysomnography to detect OSAS and were prospectively followed up to assess the risk of second eye involvement.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The prevalence of OSAS in patients with NAION and the risk of second eye involvement using survival analysis based on the presence of OSAS, indication for ventilation treatment with continuous positive airway pressure, and other potential ocular and systemic confounders.
RESULTS: In 89 patients with NAION who underwent polysomnography, 67 (75\%) had OSAS. Second eye involvement was found in 10 (13.7\%) of 73 patients at 3 years: 8 (15.4\%) of 52 patients with OSAS at 3 years and 2 (9.5\%) of 21 patients without OSAS at 3 years; P = .04. In multivariate analysis, nonadherence to ventilation treatment with continuous positive airway pressure in patients with severe OSAS increased the risk of second eye involvement (hazard ratio, 5.54; 95\% CI, 1.13-27.11; P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest that OSAS is common in patients with NAION and that polysomnography should be considered in these patients. These findings also suggest that patients with severe OSAS who are nonadherent to ventilation treatment with continuous positive airway pressure have an increased risk of second eye involvement.},

	doi = {10.1097/WNO.0000000000000186},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Use of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors has been reported to be a risk factor for development of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) in males, based largely on a number of case reports. The objective of our study was to determine whether men who use this class of medications are more likely than a matched control group to develop NAION.
METHODS: A pharmacoepidemiological nested case-control study was used to examine the above association in a health claims database of physician diagnoses and prescription medication dispensing. Cases of NAION were matched with corresponding controls and correlated with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate rate ratios for development of NAION with use of PDE-5 inhibitors.
RESULTS: A total of 1,109 cases of NAION were found and matched to 1,237,290 controls identified within the database. Cases were more likely to have hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular accident in the year preceding their NAION. The adjusted rate ratio for any use of PDE-5 inhibitor in the year before the NAION was 1.01 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-1.28); recent use of a PDE-5 inhibitor in the 30 days before the NAION also had no significant association, with an adjusted rate ratio of 0.96 (95\% CI, 0.75-1.23). Results for individual PDE-5 inhibitors did not achieve statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not suggest any association between having a prescription filled for PDE-5 inhibitor medication and receiving a diagnosis code for NAION. This is consistent with other studies in the literature that have failed to elucidate a plausible mechanism by which these drugs might compromise circulation at the optic nerve head.},

We evaluated the efficacy of a single intravitreal (IVT) injection of ranibizumab in a nonhuman primate model of NAION (pNAION).
METHODS: We induced pNAION in one eye of four adult male rhesus monkeys using a laser-activated rose Bengal induction method. We then immediately injected the eye with either ranibizumab or normal saline (NS) intravitreally. We performed a clinical assessment, optical coherence tomography, electrophysiological testing, fundus photography, and fluorescein angiography in three of the animals (one animal developed significant retinal hemorrhages and, therefore, could not be analyzed completely) prior to induction, 1 day and 1, 2, and 4 weeks thereafter. Following the 4-week analysis of the first eye, we induced pNAION in the contralateral eye and then injected either ranibizumab or NS, whichever substance had not been injected in the first eye. We euthanized all animals 5 to 12 weeks after the final assessment of the second eye and performed both immunohistochemical and light and electron microscopic analyses of the retina and optic nerves of both eyes.
RESULTS: A single IVT dose of ranibizumab administered immediately after induction of pNAION resulted in no significant reduction of clinical, electrophysiological, or histologic damage compared with vehicle-injected eyes.
CONCLUSIONS: A single IVT dose of ranibizumab is not neuroprotective when administered immediately after induction of pNAION.},

	doi = {10.1167/iovs.07-1651},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is an optic nerve (ON) stroke and a leading cause of sudden ON-related vision loss. A primate (p)NAION model is crucial to further understanding of the clinical disorder and can provide information regarding the pathophysiology of other central nervous system (CNS) ischemic axonopathies. In the current study, a primate model of NAION was developed, and short-and long-term responses to this condition were characterized.
METHODS: pNAION was induced with a novel photoembolic mechanism. Short-and long-term responses were evaluated by minimally invasive testing (electrophysiology, fundus photography, indocyanine green and fluorescein angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging) and compared with histologic and immunohistochemical findings.
RESULTS: Optic disc edema, similar to that observed in cases of human NAION was seen 1 day after induction, with subsequent resolution associated with the development of optic disc pallor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 3 months after induction revealed changes consistent with ON atrophy. Electrophysiological studies and vascular imaging suggest an ON-limited infarct with subsequent axonal degeneration and selective neuronal loss similar to that seen in human NAION. ON inflammation was evident 2 months after induction at the site of the lesion and at distant sites, suggesting that inflammation-associated axonal remodeling continues for an extended period after ON infarct.
CONCLUSIONS: pNAION resembles human NAION in many respects, with optic disc edema followed by loss of cells in the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer and ON remodeling. This model should be useful for evaluating neuroprotective and other treatment strategies for human NAION as well as for other ischemic processes that primarily affect CNS white-matter tracts.},

	doi = {10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2016.0155},
	abstract = {Importance: Retinopathy is a known risk of long-term use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate. However, whether the inner as well as outer retina are involved before retinopathy develops and whether changes in the retina might signal impending toxic effects during screening remain unknown.
Objective: To determine the degree of inner and outer retinal involvement in short- and long-term use of hydroxychloroquine before the development of retinopathy.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective medical record review of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) findings was performed at an academic medical center. Thirty-two patients without retinopathy and with high-quality SD-OCT images were studied. Twenty-seven patients were age matched (49-65 years old) for comparison of retinal layers among patients who used the drug less than 5 years (n = 12) or longer than 15 years (n = 15) at the initial visit. Populations were also defined (without age limitation) for comparison of change during 25 to 52 months of follow-up among patients with initial use of less than 5 years (n = 7) or longer than 15 years (n = 8). Data were collected from 2010 to 2015.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Measurements of inner and outer retinal thickness in SD-OCT images using commercial software and a Stanford pixel-by-pixel segmentation software that also provided topographic maps of thickness dimensions and change.
Results: Thirty-two patients (5 men and 27 women) were included in the analysis. Measurements of inner retinal thickness between short- and long-term hydroxychloroquine users (n = 27) in different retinal regions, and during a median 39 months of follow-up (n = 15), showed no statistically significant differences or change. Similarly, no significant differences or changes were identified in outer retinal thickness except for the final visit of 1 patient who developed focal parafoveal thinning, a toxic effect of hydroxychloroquine use. Cirrus ganglion cell analysis measurements were inaccurate in the presence of outer retinal damage.
Conclusions and Relevance: The inner retina appears not to be involved in hydroxychloroquine-induced retinopathy to any clinically relevant degree within the limitations of our sample size. No clinically apparent warning of outer retinal damage was seen in the SD-OCT images of long-term hydroxychloroquine users until the actual appearance of focal retinopathy. Early detection of hydroxychloroquine-induced retinopathy is known to prevent visual acuity loss and serious progression after the therapy is stopped, and these data suggest that screening should seek distinct new areas of retinopathy (shown by topographic thickness maps) rather than long-term progressive thinning.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a rare visual disorder, has been reported in men using phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i) for erectile dysfunction.
AIM: We examined whether intermittent use of PDE5i is associated with acute NAION onset within approximately five half-lives following drug ingestion.
METHODS: One hundred two ophthalmology centers in the United States and Europe identified potential cases of NAION. An expert adjudication committee conducted a blind review of the records of those with recent PDE5i use to classify cases as Definite, Possible, or not NAION. Subjects provided information on PDEi use via telephone interview. Each NAION case's PDE5i exposure immediately prior to onset was compared against his recent patterns of use in an observational case-crossover design. A sample size of 40 cases with intermittent PDE5i exposure in the 30 days prior to NAION onset was needed to detect an odds ratio (OR) of 3.0 with 80\% power.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The daily relative risk for acute NAION on days within five half-lives of PDE5i use vs. other days was estimated via an OR obtained from conditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: Among 43 Definite NAION cases with PDE5i exposure in the prior 30 days, the OR was 2.15 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06, 4.34). When 21 Possible NAION cases were included (n = 64), the OR was 2.36 (95\% CI: 1.33, 4.19).
CONCLUSIONS: We found an approximately twofold increased risk of acute NAION within five half-lives of PDE5i use compared with use in a more prior time period. Bias from inaccurate recall of exposure was unlikely to have substantially affected the results. Based on our results, we estimate that weekly use of PDE5i adds three NAION cases per 100,000 men 50 years and older annually.},

The goal of this review is to present current data in order to permit clinicians and patients to make an educated decision about treatment.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recently, there has been a flurry of case reports, small clinical trials and testing in animal models of NAION for various treatments for NAION and this review attempts to present the data concisely with the authors' opinions about the reliability of the data.

综述目的
NAION是50岁以上人群中最常见的急性视神经病变，年发病率达到2-10/100 000（人）。多数患者最终遗留永久性视力下降和视野缺失。并没有明确证实的疗法能有效逆转本病进程或阻止原先的健侧眼发生继发事件。许多内外科疗法的研究结果尚有争议。本综述的目的是展示现有数据，以助临床医师及患者做出理智的治疗决策。
近期发现
最近，治疗NAION的各种疗法的临床报道、小型临床研究和NAION的动物实验急骤增多， 本综述试着简要呈现这些数据以及作者对数据可信度的观点。
SUMMARY:
To date, there is no class I evidence of benefit for the treatment of NAION; however, the aphorism attributed to Carl Sagan, PhD aptly applies: 'Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence'.
总结
讫今，并无I级证据证明任何疗法可使NAION患者受益，然而，让我们引用Carl Sagan博士的格言向其致敬：“证据一无所见不能证明一无所有。”

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe visual acuity outcomes of patients in the Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial (IONDT) after 24 months of follow-up.
DESIGN: The IONDT is a single-masked, multicenter, randomized clinical trial.
SETTINGS: Patients were evaluated and followed up at 25 clinical centers located throughout the United States. Data were sent to and analyzed at a central coordinating center.
PATIENTS: Two hundred fifty-eight patients 50 years or older with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and visual acuity of 20/64 or worse, but better than no light perception, were randomized to either a careful follow-up group (n=131) or an optic nerve decompression surgery (ONDS) group (n=127). Of these, 174 continued participation for at least 24 months, 89 in the careful follow-up group and 85 in the ONDS group.
METHODS: Randomized patients underwent a standard visual acuity examination at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of follow-up. The primary outcome was a change of 3 lines or more of visual acuity, defined as a difference of 0.3 in logMAR scores, between baseline and 6 months of follow-up. A secondary outcome was mean change in visual acuity (in logMAR units) at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months following baseline. These changes were estimated using available data from all randomized patients for whom we had data.
RESULTS: Of the 258 patients randomized, 143 (55.4\%) were male, and 169 (65.5\%) were 65 years or older. Mean visual acuity was statistically significantly improved from baseline value at all study visits and for both treatment groups, although visual acuity declined gradually in both groups after the 3-month visit. There were no significant differences between careful follow-up and ONDS in mean change in vision from the baseline and any follow-up time point. At 24 months of follow-up, 31.0\% of patients in the careful follow-up group and 29.4\% of patients in the ONDS group experienced an increase of 3 or more lines of vision compared with baseline acuity; 21.8\% of patients in the careful follow-up group and 20.0\% of patients in the ONDS group experienced a decrease of 3 or more lines. In patients who could read at least 1 letter on the Lighthouse chart, there was a gradual decline in mean visual acuity noted over time for both treatment groups, although acuity remained significantly better than at baseline.
CONCLUSION: Analysis of visual acuity data from patients enrolled in the IONDT at 24 months of follow-up confirms that there is no benefit of ONDS compared with careful follow-up in patients with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Arch Ophthalmol. 2000;118:793-798},

	abstract = {This study has evaluated the effects of intravitreal injection of fasudil (IVF), a Rho kinase inhibitor, in cases of recent-onset non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). In this interventional case series, 13 eyes of 13 patients diagnosed with NAION within 14 days of onset were included. The affected eyes received a 0.025 mg/0.05 ml IVF. Functional and structural outcomes were assessed at 1 month and 3 months following treatment. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was the main outcome measured with mean deviation (MD) index of VF test and peripaillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness as secondary measures. There was a statistically significant improvement in the patients' BCVA at 1 and 3 months following IVF; BCVA improved from 1.69 ± 0.55 logMAR at baseline to 0.98 ± 0.47 logMAR and 0.93 ± 0.51 logMAR at 1 and 3 months, respectively (p = 0.004). The change in BCVA was not significant between month 1 and month 3 (p = 0.22). Peripaillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness decreased from 173.5 ± 29.28 µm in the baseline evaluation to 85.8 ± 8.8 µm at 1 month, and 62.9 ± 5.97 µm at 3 months (p = 0.003). MD values changed from 24.60 ± 3.80 to 21.0 ± 6.10 and 20.5 ± 6.50 at 1 and 3 months, respectively (p = 0.007 and 0.005). This pilot study suggests that IVF may be an effective treatment for patients with recent-onset NAION. Larger studies are required to establish the therapeutsic role of fasudil for NAION.

METHODS: The Beijing Eye Study, a population-based, longitudinal study which included 4439 subjects (age 40+ years) in 2006, was repeated in 2006. In the follow-up examination, 3169 (71.4\%) subjects participated. Optic disc photographs were assessed. Diagnostic criteria for incident NAION were a small optic disc, segmental pallor, and loss of retinal nerve fiber layer and visual field in the follow-up examination, with a normal optic nerve head appearance at baseline.
RESULTS: New NAION was found in one eye, with an incidence rate of 0.03+/-0.03\% per 5 years (mean +/- standard error) (95\% confidence interval: -0.03, 0.09), or about 1:16,000 subjects per year.
CONCLUSIONS: Within a 5-year period, new NAION may develop in 1 out of 3200 adult Chinese, or 1:16,000 adult Chinese per year.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including glaucoma. Astrocytes are supposed to play a role in glaucoma pathogenesis. This study investigates the antiapoptotic and cytoprotective effects of idebenone on optic nerve head astrocytes (ONHA) under oxidative stress.
METHODS: ONHA were treated with 1 to 150 µM idebenone. Cell viability (MTT assay and live-dead assay), induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species, senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity were investigated. In addition, apoptosis (detection of histone-associated DNA fragmentation), and expression of BAX and Bcl-2, and their mRNA were determined after 48 hours and after hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment.
RESULTS: Idebenone concentrations from 1 to 50 µM showed no effects on ONHA viability. Pretreatment with 10 µM idebenone led to an increase in viability of ONHA after H2O2 treatment. In addition, idebenone pretreatment significantly attenuated the increase of histone-associated DNA fragmentation, induction of senescence-associated β-galactosidase, and intracellular reactive oxygen species after treatment with H2O2. When ONHA cells were treated with idebenone and H2O2, real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis yielded an increased expression of Bcl-2 and a decrease of BAX compared with those cells that were treated with H2O2 only.
CONCLUSIONS: Idebenone reduced senescence, oxidative stress, and apoptotic cell death in cultured ONHA in vitro. Our results suggest that idebenone may help to protect ONHA in vivo, and therefore might be helpful in preventing the progression of glaucomatous degeneration.},

	abstract = {Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is caused by a transient optic nerve ischemia and results in permanent vision loss. Currently, there is no effective treatment for this ischemic optic nerve injury. This study characterized the duration and extent of ischemia induced after a coagulopathy injury to the optic nerve of adult rats. Acute ischemia was induced in adult rats by intravenous injection of Rose Bengal dye, followed by argon green laser treatment of the vessels at the optic disc. Rats were assessed in the short-term for hypoxyprobe-1 binding and expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and fractin, markers of neuronal injury. Five months after injury, optic axon number was quantified. The coagulopathy injury resulted in short-term hypoxia in the optic nerve and retina. Tissues were hypoxic within 15 min of the coagulopathy injury, but normoxic by 24 h as measured by hypoxyprobe-1 staining. Both HIF-1alpha and fractin were upregulated in ganglion cells variably across the retina. Five months after the ischemic injury, there was a 71\% reduction in optic axon number compared to controls. It is critical to have a reproducible and relevant method for producing transient hypoxia in order to test therapeutic strategies for rescuing injured neurons. The coagulopathy induced in this study resulted in a reproducible and transient ischemic optic nerve injury and long-term axonal loss. This ischemia shows similar, although not identical, morphological and physiological changes to those seen in the human eye after optic nerve ischemia. We are currently testing therapeutic strategies to protect ganglion cells from degeneration after this ischemic injury.},

We hope our findings may contribute to the understanding NAION pathogenesis and provide some clues for the prevention and treatment of optic diseases. The NAION group contains 113 subjects (33 males and 80 females, mean age 55.3 ± 9.8). And 98 subjects were enrolled in the control group (32 males and 66 females, mean age 56.7 ± 10.2). The individuals involved in the study were matched by gender and age to obtain two homogenous groups. GSTM1- and GSTT1- genotype and the combined genotype were investigated. The genotype distributions in NAION patients were compared with those in the controls. Significantly altered intraocular pressure (IOP) and cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) was detected between NAION patients and controls. An increased risk of NAION was observed among individuals with GSTM1- (P {\textless} 0.001). No significant difference was confirmed for GSTT1- (P = 0.290). Individuals with GSTM1-/GSTT1- have a higher susceptibility to NAION (P {\textless} 0.001); the GSTM1-/GSTT1+ genotype also had a significantly higher frequency in patients than in controls (P = 0.004). But the genotype of GSTM1+/GSTT1- seems to have no connection with NAION (P = 0.476). In conclusion, in this study, we confirmed the connection between NAION and GSTM1- genotype. But no significant association was observed between GSTT1- genotype and NAION susceptibility. In further analysis regarding combined genotype, a trend of protective effect was detected for GSTT1+ genotype. It is indicated by our result that oxidative compounds might play an important part in the pathogenesis of NAION.},

	abstract = {Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy(NA-AION) is the most common cause of acute ischemic damage to the optic nerve(ON), and the leading cause of seriously impaired vision in people over 55 years of age. It demonstrated that subcutaneous administration of Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF) reduces RGC death in an ON crush model in rats, and that the neuroprotective effects may involve both anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory processes. Our recent work shows that the protective actions of G-CSF in rAION models may involve both anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory processes. However, the exact rescuing mechanisms involved in the administration of G-CSF in rAION models need further investigation. In addition, further studies on the administration of G-CSF at different time intervals after the induction of rAION may be able to illustrate whether treatment given at a later time is still neuroprotective. Further, it is unknown whether treatment using G-CSF combined with other drugs will result in a synergistic effect in a rAION model. Inflammation induced by ischemia plays an essential role on the ON head in NA-AION, which can result in disc edema and compartment changes. Therefore, it is reasonable that adding an anti-inflammatory drug may enhance the therapeutic effects of G-CSF. An ongoing goal is to evaluate the novel sites of action of both G-CSF and other anti-inflammatory drugs, and to identify the functionally protective pathways to enhance RGC survival. These investigations may open up new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of ischemic optic neuropathy.},

【方法】
造模后1，3，5，7，14天和1个月后处死大鼠，每时间点4只。
【指标】
SMI312 轴突退变
GAP-43 轴突再生

Iba1 标记炎症细胞包括巨噬细胞和小神经胶质细胞中特异表达的离子化钙耦联受体膜蛋白（钙通道配适蛋白-1，ionized calcium channel adapter protein-1）.
ED1 标记血源性或外源性巨噬细胞（一种由新产生的单核细胞/巨噬细胞表达的蛋白）。
双重标记：切片用两种一抗孵育过夜，再加其中一种染色二抗。
TUNEL 细胞调亡；根据试剂盒公司说明书做。
【结果】
前期试验发现，3天后ED1(+)/Iba1(+)有明显渗透，巩膜内轴突的缺血梗塞区及其附近的巩膜前后视神经出现结构紊乱（Zhang et al, 2009）
本试验发现，7天后这种损伤更严重，更有后段整条视神经包括眶内IFL的SMI312染色缺失。
SMI312的染色缺失在14天更严重，预示着Wallerian变性的速度。
Wallerian degeneration：瓦氏变性，指轴突和髓鞘的分解吸收，以及施万细胞增生等现象，在神经断裂后开始，一般在神经伤后8周左右完成。（百度百科）
TUNEL
正常组的ONL、INL、RGC的TUNEL阳性细胞极少。1天和3天的TUNEL(+)细胞在各层都很少，第7天仅RGC层见显著阳性。
第7天，9切面（3只动物，每只3个切面）RGC半量化(Semi-quantification)计数。每切面数3个高倍镜视野，不数纺缍形内皮细胞。发现3只眼的平均TUNEL(+)细胞有42.5\%（所以阴性的也要数！！！！！），而且3只眼都是只有一边阳性，表明病变造成RGC局灶性死亡（所以3个高倍镜到底怎么选？？？不影响比率？），和之前发表的结果相符(Bernstein et al., 2007)。
ED1/Iba1
正常组ED1(+)极少见，而Iba1(+)细胞散见于RGC层、IPL和INL，直到7天，ED1(+)都没有什么变化，而Iba1则在各内层都有显著变化。这些阳性细胞可能是小神经胶质细胞（所以其实你们也不知道是什么。。），表明病变导致特异性RGC凋亡，以及视网膜小神经胶质细胞活化，而不是系统性补充巨噬细胞。
GAP-43
正常组没有阳性。直到第7天才见阳性，且根据病变程度不同，有单侧或全神经的不同程度表达，且仅有NFL和巩膜内和前段ON，后段ON都没有。末端也没有，可能是因为此区的轴突严重缺失。1个月后又很少了，可能是都丢完了。这个可能可以显示缺血灶边缘，见前期（Zhang et al, 2009）。
此外，SMI312显示，7天后有严重的轴突丢失，此时GAP-43在NFL也可见。14天后GAP-43(+)仍可见，但1个月后就没了。
造模后的损伤程度有个体差异，同样GAP-43的再生应答也有。
由于GAP-43难以量化，“所在我们又用另外4只动物造模，造成50\%RGC缺失”（by how？），然后又在第14天染了GAP-43和SMI312。
正常组的视网膜和ON仍阴性，但神经丝蛋白（neurofilament）充满ON(?)，14天后GAP-43强表达，但巩膜内段以外的ON非常少。SMI312也显示局灶性神经丝蛋白丢失，某些区域有残余的完整丝蛋白。某些SMI312(+)区内有GAP-43(+)，但病灶区的SMI312(+)是没有GAP-43表达的。
梗塞后ON瘢痕形成
由于巩膜外段ON的GAP-43非常少，我们认为这表示轴突再生失败。由于胶质瘢痕会阻抑轴突再生（Shen et al., 2009)，我们又染了胶质瘢痕内的胞外基糖蛋白（extracellular protein laminin）(Grimpe and Silver, 2002)，14天后缺血灶强染，表明有广泛的血管化胶质瘢痕形成，而正常组很少。
【讨论】
。。。。
SMI312显示，在第3天开始看到轴突结构明显率乱，但此时还相对完整（intact），但7天和14天的病变进展速度很快，和其他瓦氏病变模型相似，轴突变性沿神经走行向远端进展。
RGC神经细胞死亡是由于轴突变性和功能不全，5-7天开始凋亡，到2周后丢失90\%，和前人研究相符（Villegas-Perez et al., 1988,1993）。但在我们的模型中，RGC死亡也从7天开始，但过程更长，到2-3周仍有50\%存留（Goldenberg-Cohen el al., 2005; Slater et al., 2007）。我们在7天的TUNEL(+)就有42.5\%，而在Slater的研究中（2008），用膜联蛋白V(Annexin V)标记的RGC早期凋亡的高峰出现在第10天，这可能是由于个体差异或方法不同造成（= =）。然而两个研究都表明，ON梗阻后有一个RGC凋亡的延后，这种延后可能表明该病变有一个较长的“治疗窗”。So，推鼠及人，这种假设在人类应该也是成立的。（So let's Go！！）
至于ED1在各时间点的表达都很少，而7天视网膜内层的小神经胶质细胞Iba1(+)显著，表明，不同于原发灶，在病变时视网膜原有细胞(cells intrinsic to the retina)出现了炎性反应。这和进行轴索显微外科手术(axotomy)的视网膜变化相似(Zhang el al., 2004)，表示ON梗塞后，有完整的血-视网膜屏障维护。},

	abstract = {Dye-sensitized photochemical thrombosis is a new method of producing vascular occlusion in the eye for experimental purposes. The rate and duration of photodynamic occlusions of branch retinal vessels was measured in pigmented and albino rat eyes after intravenous injection of the photosensitizing dye, rose bengal. Selected vessels were exposed to focused, white light until vascular occlusion was observed biomicroscopically. A slit lamp was used for a light source in this procedure, allowing adjustment of spot size, shape, and orientation. Arterioles occluded more rapidly than venules, and the time required to produce vascular occlusion decreased when animals breathed pure oxygen administered by face mask. Rose bengal doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg were effective, 20 mg/kg was partially effective, and 1 and 10 mg/kg were ineffective in producing branch arteriole occlusion at a light intensity of 73.5 mW/cm2. The total light energy required to produce occlusion increased from an average of 0.06 J using 80 mg/kg to 0.50 J using 20 mg/kg of rose bengal. Lower light intensities produced vessel occlusion less rapidly (46 mW/cm2) or not at all (17.5 mW/cm2). The rate of retinal arteriolar occlusion was not affected by ocular pigmentation. The duration of branch vessel occlusion depended on length of vessel treated and did not exceed 3 days in arterioles and 4 days in venules. Histologic sections showed discrete areas of retinal and choroidal vascular thrombosis confined to the area of direct light exposure. Choroidal vascular thrombosis and outer retinal damage predominated in eyes treated at low light intensity. Thrombosis usually extended into the deep choroidal vessels in albino but not pigmented eyes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {We have established a mouse model of intimal thickening and assessed its suitability for experimental studies of intimal thickening. Neointimal formation was observed after endothelial injury by photochemical reaction between transluminal green light and systemically administered rose Bengal, which represents a nonmechanical approach to vessel wall denudation. Intimal thickening began 7 days after endothelial injury, reached a maximum after 21 days, and then remained unchanged for as long as 42 days. Furthermore, as a consequence of neointimal proliferation, the luminal area gradually decreased. The cells in the neointimal layer were identified as smooth muscle cells by immunohistochemical staining with an alpha-actin-specific antibody. Extracellular matrix deposition in the neointima was markedly increased beyond 14 days after injury. Smooth muscle cell proliferation, as measured by pulse labeling of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, was identified initially in the media 2 days after vessel wall denudation, with the proliferative activity's shifting almost exclusively to the neointima within 7 days. Endothelial regeneration, as indicated by Evans blue staining, was complete within 21 days after injury. To assess the suitability of this model for experimental studies on intimal thickening, the effect of tranilast, an antiallergy drug with a broad spectrum of pharmacological actions on intimal thickening, was investigated. Tranilast (100 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) p.o.) significantly (P{\textless}0.05) reduced smooth muscle cell proliferation in the neointima and media 7 days after injury and neointimal formation 21 days after injury in treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice. This simple experimental mouse model is suitable for studying factors promoting or inhibiting intimal thickening after endothelial injury and for developing therapeutic strategies against intimal thickening.},

	abstract = {Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) can be divided into nonarteritic (NAION) and arteritic (AAION) forms. NAION makes up {\textasciitilde}85\% of all cases of AION, and until recently was poorly understood. There is no treatment for NAION, and its initiating causes are poorly understood, in part because NAION is not lethal, making it difficult to obtain fresh, newly affected tissue for study. In-vivo electrophysiology and post-mortem studies reveal specific responses that are associated with NAION. New models of NAION have been developed which enable insights into the pathophysiological events surrounding this disease. These models include both rodent and primate species, and the power of a 'vertically integrated' multi-species approach can help in understanding the common cellular mechanisms and physiological responses to clinical NAION, and to identify potential approaches to treatment. The models utilize laser light to activate intravascular photoactive dye to induce capillary vascular thrombosis, while sparing the larger vessels. The observable optic nerve changes associated with rodent models of AION (rAION) and primate NAION (pNAION) are indistinguishable from that seen in clinical disease, including sectoral axonal involvement, and in-vivo electrophysiological data from these models are consistent with clinical data. Early post-infarct events reveal an unexpected inflammatory response, and changes in intraretinal gene expression for both stress response, while sparing outer retinal function, which occurs in AAION models. Histologically, the NAION models reveal an isolated loss of retinal ganglion cells by apoptosis. There are changes detectable by immunohistochemistry suggesting that other retinal cells mount a brisk response to retinal ganglion cell distress without themselves dying. The optic nerve ultimately shows axonal loss and scarring. Inflammation is a prominent early histological feature. This suggests that clinically, specific modulation of inflammation may be a useful approach to NAION treatment early in the course of the disease.},

	volume = {8},
	issn = {1528-9117},
	abstract = {Photodynamic therapy is one of several techniques developed for phototherapy for solid cancers and hematologic malignancies. Photodynamic therapy is a treatment that utilizes a molecular energy exchange between visible light and a photosensitive drug, which results in the production of 1O2, a highly reactive cytocidal oxygen species. The effect is limited to the region where light and drug are combined so that malignant tissue is destroyed and the usual side effects associated with standard cancer therapies are avoided. The light component of photodynamic therapy is customarily generated via dye-pumped or diode lasers. The cost and the complexity of lasers have seriously limited the clinical use of photodynamic therapy for malignancies. A new device technology, based on light-emitting diodes, has been developed (Light Sciences Corporation, Issaquah, WA) that allows light production inside the target tissue. This new technology will expand the current range of indications that are treatable with photodynamic therapy to include moderate- and large-volume refractorytumors. Conventional photodynamic therapy utilizes the delivery of intense light for seconds or minutes. The new approach differs from conventional photodynamic therapy in that it combines a novel interstitial light delivery system with prolonged photoactivation of photosensitive drugs. Prolonging photoactivation time in order to deliver a higher light dose results in an amplification effect, whereby the repeated activation of each photosensitive drug molecule leads to the generation of many thousands of 1O2 molecules. The production of overwhelming numbers of these powerful oxidants in individual cells and the vascular supply of tumors leads to irreversible damage and death of the targeted lesions. Results of preclinical studies have indicated a significant correlation between increased duration of photoactivation and increased volume and depth of photodynamic therapy-induced necrosis. The new developments will enable photodynamic therapy to be used effectively against refractory bulky disease as frontline therapy or in combination with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or biologics. Perhaps most promising, many patients with advanced refractory disease may now be relieved of symptoms or may return to the treatable population.},

	abstract = {In central nervous system injury, the secondary degeneration process is known to play a major role in determining the final extent of impairment. Here, we investigated the mechanism of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death in secondary degeneration of the optic nerve using a unique model that allows morphological separation between primary and secondary degeneration. A partial transection model was applied unilaterally in 110 Wistar rat eyes. The rate of apoptosis was evaluated in primary and secondary degeneration over a period of 6 months using the Hoechst staining technique. The involvement of caspase 3 and members of the Bcl-2 family (Bax, Bad, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) was evaluated at multiple time points for 6 months after the injury by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. We found that in secondary degeneration of the optic nerve, RGCs died by apoptosis from day 3-6 months following the injury, peaking at 3 months (16.3\% +/- 2.5\% apoptotic cells, p {\textless} 0.01). Both primary and secondary degeneration of the optic nerve resulted in caspase 3 activation, which was longer and more intense in the former. Similarly, both primary and secondary degeneration led to significant (p {\textless} 0.05) downregulation of the pro-survival genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-x-L and up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic genes Bax and Bad (p {\textless} 0.05), with a suggested delay in secondary degeneration. Thus, secondary degeneration of the optic nerve leads to RGC apoptosis over long periods in a similar mechanism as in primary degeneration.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the clinical effectiveness and potential neuroprotection of levodopa in improving visual acuity, visual field, and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in eyes affected by NAION.
METHOD: Retrospective cohort study involving 59 eyes of 59 participants with NAION who were evaluated within 15 days of NAION onset. Participants received 25 mg carbidopa/100 mg levodopa three times daily with meals for 12 weeks (levodopa group) or were untreated (control group). Best-corrected visual acuity converted to logMAR, mean deviation (MD) threshold sensitivity on automated perimetry, and mean RNFL thickness on optical coherence tomography (OCT) were assessed. The primary outcome was the categorization of eyes into improved visual acuity (by 0.3 logMAR difference), worsened visual acuity (by 0.3 logMAR difference), or no change in visual acuity. The proportions in each category were compared between the levodopa and control groups.
RESULTS: Among participants with 20/60 or worse initial visual acuity, levodopa-treated participants had significant improvement (P {\textless} 0.0001) in the mean change from initial to final logMAR visual acuity of -0.74 ± 0.56 (95 \% CI, -0.98 to -0.50), while the mean change for the control group at -0.37 ± 1.09 (95 \% confidence interval estimate, -1.00 to +0.26) was not significant (P = 0.23). A significant difference between groups was observed (P = 0.0086) such that 19/23 (83 \%) in the levodopa group improved and none got worse, as compared with 6/14 (43 \%) in the control group improving while four (29 \%) worsened. The change in visual field MD and RNFL thickness on OCT showed no significant difference at P = 0.23 and P = 0.75 respectively. No levodopa-treated participant had any adverse event from the levodopa.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment within 15 days of onset of NAION with levodopa improved central visual acuity by an average of 6 lines on Snellen acuity chart. Levodopa may promote neuroprotection of the maculopapular retinal ganglion cell fibers in NAION.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is caused by sudden loss of vascular supply to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in the anterior portion of the optic nerve and is a major cause of optic nerve dysfunction. There has been no easily obtainable animal model of this disorder. The current study was conducted to design a novel model of rodent AION (rAION), to enable more detailed study of this disease.
METHODS: A novel rodent photoembolic stroke model was developed that is directly analogous to human AION. Using histologic, electrophysiological, molecular- and cell biological methods, the early changes associated with isolated RGC axonal ischemia were characterized.
RESULTS: Functional (electrophysiological) changes occurred in RGCs within 1 day after rAION, with a loss of visual evoked potential (VEP) amplitude that persisted in the long term. The retinal gene expression pattern rapidly changed after rAION induction, with an early ({\textless}1 day) initial induction of c-Fos mRNA, and loss of RGC-specific gene expression. RGC-specific protein expression declined 2 days after detectable mRNA level changes, and immunostaining suggested that multiple retinal layers react to isolated RGC axonal ischemia.
CONCLUSIONS: rAION rapidly results in electrophysiological and histologic changes similar to clinical AION, with reactive responses in primary and supporting neuronal cell layers. The rAION model can enable a detailed analysis of the individual retinal and optic nerve changes that occur after optic nerve stroke, which may be useful in determining possible therapeutic interventions for this disorder.},

RESULTS: There was a statistically significant elevation in the mean +/- SEM vitreous concentrations of glutamate (264\% +/-41\%; P = .04), aspartate (269\% +/-31\%; P = .04), and glycine (232\% +/-26\%; P = .04) in the eyes subjected to endothelin-1 when compared with the fellow control eyes.
CONCLUSION: Administration of endothelin-1 to the microvasculature of the optic nerve leads to elevation of glutamate, aspartate, and glycine concentrations in the vitreous.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The increase of excitatory amino acids in the vitreous might be associated with various ischemic processes of the optic nerve, including glaucomatous optic neuropathy, and may play a role in the neuronal damage that is seen in these diseases.},

The contralateral uninvolved eyes were used as controls. The retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was determined by optical coherence tomography which showed that the mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness from temporal, superior, nasal and inferior quadrants were significantly higher for all measurements in the acute stage than the corresponding normal values. In comparison, the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness from each optic disc quadrant was found to be significantly lower when measured at the resolving stages, than in the control group. Statistical analysis on the correlation between optic disc nerve fiber layer thickness and visual defects demonstrated a positive correlation in the acute stage and a negative correlation in the resolving stage. Our experimental findings indicate that optical coherence tomography is a useful diagnostic method for nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and can be used to evaluate the effect of treatment.},

Adult rats received a unilateral ONC and after 21 days the numbers of Brn3a(+), βIII-tubulin(+) and Islet-1(+) RGCs were quantified in either retinal radial sections or wholemounts in which FluoroGold (FG) was injected 48 h before harvesting. Phenotypic antibody markers were used to distinguish RGCs from astrocytes, macrophages/microglia and amacrine cells. In wholemounted retinae, counts of FG(+) and Brn3a(+) RGCs were of similar magnitude in eyes with intact optic nerves and were similarly reduced after ONC. Larger differences in RGC number were detected between intact and ONC groups when images were taken closer to the optic nerve head. In radial sections, Brn3a did not stain astrocytes, macrophages/microglia or amacrine cells, whereas βIII-tubulin and Islet-1 did localize to amacrine cells as well as RGCs. The numbers of βIII-tubulin(+) RGCs was greater than Brn3a+ RGCs, both in retinae from eyes with intact optic nerves and eyes 21 days after ONC. Islet-1 staining also overestimated the number of RGCs compared to Brn3a, but only after ONC. Estimates of RGC loss were similar in Brn3a-stained radial retinal sections compared to both Brn3a-stained wholemounts and retinal wholemounts in which RGCs were backfilled with FG, with sections having the added advantage of reducing experimental animal usage.},

切片的细胞难免被劈，所以只数那些大小和周围DAPI(+)细胞核相似的细胞。

但总之结论是，计算RGC丢失百分比时，切片和平铺的结果是相似的。},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) has been shown to protect retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in traumatic optic nerve injury. We sought to evaluate this neuroprotective effect of CNTF after an ischaemic event using rodent anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (rAION), a mouse model of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION).
METHODS: We induced rAION in Thy1-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) transgenic mice by exposing the optic nerve to frequency doubled neodymium yttrium aluminium garnet laser pulses following intravenous rose bengal injection. One day after rAION induction, an intravitreal injection of 0.75 μg CNTF or vehicle (sham injection) was given. Animals were euthanised on day 15 after induction, tissues isolated and CFP cells in the RGC layer were counted using stereology in flat-mounted retina. The average number of CFP-positive (CFP+) cells was determined for each study group and the percentages of RGC loss were compared between the different groups.
RESULTS: Two weeks after rAION induction, significantly more (CFP+) cells were preserved in CNTF-treated eyes than in sham-injected controls. Sham-treated animals showed a 58\% loss of CFP+ cells. In contrast, CFP+ cell density in CNTF-treated eyes decreased by only 10\%, when compared with untreated control eyes. This increased survival was statistically significant (p{\textless}0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: CNTF exerts a neuroprotective effect in ischaemic optic nerve injury and promotes RGC survival, suggesting that CNTF may be effective in the clinical treatment of human NAION.},

方法：将22例(26眼)缺血性视神经病变患者行中医辨证治疗,作为治疗组,根据病人情况分为肝经实热证、气血两虚证、肝郁气滞证、阴虚火旺证四种证型,分别予龙胆泻肝汤加减(清肝泄热)、逍遥散合桃红四物汤加减(疏肝解郁、行气活血)、知柏地黄丸加减(滋阴降火)、人参养荣汤加减(益气养血),并联合复方樟柳碱穴位注射治疗；以单纯复方樟柳碱穴位注射治疗作为对照组。协同治疗：患病初期或视盘水肿者,加用激素治疗。在视力、视野等方面进行治疗前后的比较,对所得数据进行统计学处理,验证中药治疗本病的疗效,分析患者性别、年龄、基础视力及病程与疗效是否具有相关性,并对治疗组与对照组进行视力、视野有效率的评价。
结果：1.在视力结果分析中,患者治疗后视力明显改善(P{\textless}0.05)；2.在视野结果分析中,治疗后平均光敏度增加(P{\textless}0.05),平均缺损减少(P{\textless}0.05)；3.在疗效相关因素分析中,疗效与性别、年龄、基础视力三者具有明显相关性(P{\textless}0.05),且女性组优于男性组,年轻者优于年长者,基础视力高者优于基础视力差者,而病程与疗效无明显相关性(P{\textgreater}0.05)；4.将治疗组与对照组的视力、视野有效率进行比较,P{\textless}0.05,差异有统计学意义,表明治疗组疗效优于对照组。
结论：中医辨证用药治疗能够提高患者的视力、视野平均视敏度,减少视野平均缺损,从而有效地改善患者的视功能,巩固疗效。因此,中医在治疗缺血性视神经病变中具有良好的理论和临床应用价值。},

	abstract = {恶性肿瘤是目前医药界急待攻克的难题,尽管现有的治疗手段如：手术、放化疗和免疫疗法一直在不断进步,可是我们仍需继续寻找对付肿瘤的新方法。光动力疗法(Photodynamic Therapy, PDT)是一种基于光敏剂、氧和激发光的微创肿瘤治疗技术,其中光敏剂是PDT治疗的关键。针对目前临床常用光敏剂存在的细胞摄取量低、代谢缓慢、缺乏靶向性和滞后的光毒性等问题,我们开展了新型光敏剂的研究。本论文涉及两个体系的新型水溶性光敏剂：氨基多羧酸修饰四苯基卟啉系列和糖基修饰氟硼二吡咯系列,研究它们的理化性质、体内外抗肿瘤活性和作用机制,以期开发高效、低毒的光动力抗肿瘤候选新药。 	第一部分：氨基多羧酸修饰四苯基卟啉化合物的研究 	化合物A1-9：①我们利用高效液相色谱法测定化合物A1-9的含量,结果表明化合物A1-9的含量均大于95\%；②用紫外分光光度法测定化合物A1-9的光漂白速率、单线态氧产率和脂水分配系数,结果表明化合物A1-9的光稳定性好,单线态氧产率在0.41-0.61范围内,脂水分配系数在1.79-2.96之间；③用荧光分光光度法测定人肝癌细胞Hep G2、人胃癌细胞HGC-27、人胃腺癌细胞BGC：823和人非小细胞肺癌细胞A549对化合物A1-9的吸收量,结果表明给药浓度为201μM时,四种肿瘤细胞对化合物A1-9的药物吸收量均在0.1-0.4μM/1×104cells范围内；④用荧光显微镜和激光共聚焦显微镜观察化合物A1-9在上述四种肿瘤细胞中的定位情况,结果显示化合物A1-9主要定位于细胞溶酶体；⑤以上述四种肿瘤细胞为研究对象,用MTT法检测化合物A1-9对肿瘤细胞的光动力杀伤作用,结果表明化合物A1-9在1.25-20μM剂量范围内的暗毒性较小,而在光照条件下能显著抑制体外培养的人肝癌、胃癌和肺癌细胞的增殖,其中化合物A7效果最好,对四种肿瘤细胞的最大抑制率大于84\%,IC50值小于0.89gM。 	苗头化合物A10：①我们以人大细胞肺癌细胞NCI-H460、人骨肉瘤细胞U-2OS、人脐静脉内皮细胞ECV-304、人增生性瘢痕成纤维细胞FB和人永生化表皮细胞HaCat为研究对象,评价苗头化合物A10对肿瘤细胞和正常细胞的选择性杀伤作用,结果表明苗头化合物A10对两种肿瘤细胞的光毒性强,最大抑制率大于71\%,IC50值小于6μM,对三种正常细胞的光毒性小,最大抑制率小于24\%,IC50值大于20μM；②以人肝癌细胞Hep G2和人胃腺癌细胞BGC-823为研究对象,用流式细胞仪检测A10-PDT对肿瘤细胞凋亡和细胞周期的影响,结果表明A10-PDT可诱导人肝癌细胞Hep G2和人胃腺癌细胞BGC-823发生凋亡,将人肝癌细胞Hep G2阻滞于Go/Gl期,并且呈剂量依赖关系；③用等温滴定量热法和圆二色谱法探讨苗头化合物A10与牛血清白蛋白(BSA)的相互作用,结果表明苗头化合物A10与蛋白质BSA的作用力类型以氢键、范德华力和静电引力为主,可诱导BSA二级结构单元a-Helix的含量减少,β-Turn的含量增加；④用最大给药量法测试A10-PDT的急性毒性,结果表明A10-PDT无严重急性中毒的危险性；⑤以移植性Lewis肺癌小鼠、移植性肝癌H22小鼠、移植性人胃腺癌BGC-823裸小鼠为模型,评价苗头化合物A10的体内光动力治疗效果,结果表明给药剂量为20mg/kg时,A10-PDT对移植性Lewis肺癌小鼠的最大肿瘤抑制率为81.52\%,对肝癌H22小鼠的最大肿瘤抑制率为95.15\%,给药剂量为1Omg/kg和5mg/kg时,A10-PDT对人胃腺癌BGC-823裸小鼠的肿瘤生长有明显的抑制作用；⑥用荧光成像法和冰冻切片法探讨苗头化合物A10在荷瘤动物体内的组织分布情况,结果表明尾静脉注射24h,苗头化合物A10在各组织中的浓度大致为肿瘤{\textgreater}肝{\textgreater}肺{\textgreater}肾{\textgreater}脾{\textgreater}心,给药后12-48h肿瘤组织中的药物浓度处于较高水平。 	第二部分：糖基修饰氟硼二吡咯化合物的研究 	化合物B1-6：①我们用紫外分光光度法测定化合物B1-6的光漂白速率、单线态氧产率和脂水分配系数,结果表明化合物B1-6的光漂白速率较慢,单线态氧产率在0.073-0.29范围内,脂水分配系数在0.37-2.69之间；②用荧光显微镜和激光共聚焦显微镜观察化合物B1-6在入肝癌细胞Hep G2、人胃癌细胞HGC-27、人大细胞肺癌细胞NCI-H460和人肝细胞L02中的定位情况,结果显示化合物B1-6在细胞线粒体和溶酶体中均有分布；③以上述四种细胞为研究对象,用MTT法检测化合物B1-6对细胞的光动力杀伤作用,结果表明化合物B1-6在1.25-20μM剂量范围内结合激光照射能显著抑制体外培养的人肝癌、胃癌和肺癌细胞的增殖,对肝细胞的杀伤作用较肿瘤细胞小,其中化合物B3具有特殊的暗毒性,对肿瘤细胞的最大抑制率大于80\%,IC50值小于0.18gM。 	苗头化合物B3：①用寇氏法测试苗头化合物B3的小鼠急性毒性,结果表明B3的半数致死量为149.70mg/kg;②以移植性肝癌H22小鼠、移植性人肝癌Hep G2裸小鼠为模型,评价苗头化合物B3的体内抗肿瘤效果,结果表明给药剂量为10mg/kg时,B3对移植性肝癌H22小鼠的最大肿瘤抑制率为69.21\%,给药剂量为10mg/kg和5mg/kg时,B3对人肝癌Hep G2裸小鼠的肿瘤生长有明显的抑制作用。},

	abstract = {目的：前部缺血性视神经病变(anterior ischemid optic-neuropathy, AION)是供应筛板前区的后睫状动脉循环障碍所致,致视盘局部发生梗死,表现为突发无痛性视力障碍、视盘水肿及特征性视野缺损,继之视神经萎缩,是一种致盲性很高的难治性眼病。临床上西医多采用局部与全身相配合治疗,如糖皮质激素、血管扩张剂、复方樟柳碱注射液、视神经保护剂等药物治疗。但是AION患者多合并有糖尿病、高血压、心脑血管等疾病,或全身症状不适宜使用皮质类固醇治疗,使得临床治疗时较棘手。导师高健生研究员根据多年临床经验,结合中医辨证论治,在长期临床基础上总结出“益气温阳通络法",自拟“益气通脉方”,并联合葛根素注射液静脉滴注,用以治疗AION取得一定疗效。为进一步证实益气通脉方联合葛根素治疗AION的临床疗效,形成诊疗方案,为临床推广及名老中医经验传承提供客观依据,本文回顾性分析益气通脉方联合葛根素治疗AION,评价其临床疗效,探讨该法的作用机理以及重点讨论疗效的相关影响因素。方法：采用回顾性研究,系统分析符合纳入标准的58例(69只眼,其中双眼发病者11例)AION患者的临床资料,所有纳入患者均采用口服中药益气通脉方并联合葛根素注射液静脉滴注方案进行治疗。合并糖尿病、高血压病、高脂血症等内科疾病的患者均给与相应内科药物治疗。观察视力、视野(平均视敏度、平均缺损度、丢失方差)中医证候等指标。采用SAS9.2统计软件对所得数据进行统计分析,评价其临床疗效。结果：1.治疗总有效率70.86\%,显效率达29.31\%,表明益气通脉方联合葛根素是治疗前部缺血性视神经病变的有效方案。2.治疗前后最佳矫正视力比较,P{\textless}0.05,具有统计学意义,表明益气通脉方联合葛根素治疗前部缺血性视神经病变能有效改善患者的视力。3.治疗前后视野各项指标比较,P{\textless}0.05,具有统计学意义,表明益气通脉方联合葛根素治疗前部缺血性视神经病变能有效改善患者的视野。4.治疗前视力与疗效呈负相关性,即治疗前视力越差治疗效果越好。5.发病时间与疗效呈负相关性,即发病时间越短疗效越好。6.发病年龄与疗效呈正相关性,即发病年龄越大疗效越好。7.中医证候疗效有效率为88.89\%,显效率为16.67\%,表明益气通脉方联合葛根素的治疗方案能有效改善前部缺血性视神经病变患者的中医证候。结论：1.益气通脉方联合葛根素能有效改善患者的视力、视野及中医证候,是治疗AION的有效方案。3.治疗前视力与疗效呈负相关性,即治疗前视力越差治疗效果越好。4.发病时间与疗效呈负相关性,即发病时间越短疗效越好。5.发病年龄与疗效呈正相关性,即发病年龄越大疗效越好。},

	abstract = {目的  外伤性视神经病(TON)随着目前交通事故的增多而增加，临床上诊断与治疗该病的方法多样，治疗效果各家报道不一，未形成统一的诊治标准，并且缺乏相关的实验研究。尤其在动物实验研究方面，国内研究甚少。我们从建立外伤性视神经病动物模型入手，应用客观的检查方法，建立模拟该病的动物模型，为进一步探讨外伤性视神经病的发病机理、诊治标准及预后提供参考。     方法  选择健康成年家兔2只、家猫2只，处死后解剖观察鼻腔鼻窦及视神经的解剖关系，确定家猫为实验动物。选择健康成年家猫8只，以自身左眼为实验眼，右眼为对照眼，术前检测视觉诱发电位(VISUAL EVOKED POTENTIAL，VEP)。经鼻腔筛蝶窦入路，用自制视神经管损伤器损伤管内段视神经，建立TON模型，检测图形视觉诱发电位(PR-VEP)，观察动物瞳孔对光反应。以PR-VEP波形改变为模型建立成功检测的指标。观察动物分别在术后1h、1d、3d、1w、2w、4w时的PR-VEP波形和瞳孔变化。     结果  家猫的鼻窦结构与视神经走行与人类相似，有完整的视神经管，为较适合的实验动物。内镜下经鼻腔鼻窦入路寻找视神经管方法可行。8只猫损伤后有4只瞳孔不同程度散大，直接对光反应减弱或消失，间接对光反应灵敏，但有4只家猫的瞳孔对光反应双侧无明显差异。PR-VEP中N\_(75)P\_(100)、P\_(100)N\_(145)波幅均减小，N\_(75)、P\_(100)、N\_(145)峰潜时均延长。损伤后1h、1d、3d、1w时的N\_(75)P\_(100)、P\_(100)N\_(145)波幅分别平均为8.60±1.32uv、7.90±0.39uv；6.81±1.22uv、3.40±0.43uv；6.00±2.07uv、4.50±0.78uv；6.60±1.62uv、3.00±0.78uv。N\_(75)、P\_(100)、N\_(145)各峰潜时分别平均为82.80±0.69ms、120.60±1.36ms、174.00±2.94ms；106.30±7.14ms、136.80±6.17ms、178.20±7.28ms；101.40±5.68ms、144.60±6.16ms、191.40±9.59ms；106.80±10.08ms、148.80±12.02ms、202.80±12.16ms。损伤后2w与4w时PR-VEP的波形引出为一条近似直线，无法测出各波幅及各峰潜时的数值。损伤前与损伤后1h、1d、3d、1w PR-VEP比较为P＜0.05；1h与1d、3d、1w比较P值＜0.05，1d、3d、1w之间两两比较P值＞0.05或＜0.05。     结论  ①家猫的鼻窦结构与视神经走行与人类相似，有完整的视神经管，为较适合的实验动物。②内镜下经鼻腔筛蝶窦入路建立视神经损伤动物模型方法可行； 第一章中文摘要 ③视神经管损伤前、后的VEP改变明显，VEP变化可作为外伤性视神经病动物模型的 客观监测指标;瞳孔对光反射不宜作为TON动物模型建立成功与否的检测指标},

	abstract = {一、应用FP I建立兔外伤性视神经病变动物模型
目的应用液压冲击颅脑损伤仪建立兔外伤性视神经病变动物模型。方法应用液压冲击颅脑损伤仪(FPI)建立兔外伤性视神经病变模型。将兔分为正常对照组和损伤后1d、7d、14d、28d亚组,每组各8只。观察损伤后不同时间点视觉诱发电位及视网膜形态学变化。结果(1)对照组视网膜及脉络膜结构良好,层次清晰,RGC呈单层排列,整齐密集,胞核清楚,核膜光滑完整；视神经损伤后视网膜各层结构变薄,细胞数量逐渐减少,RGCs出现核固缩,染色加深,排列稀疏,逐渐出现空化RGCs。(2)正常对照组视觉诱发电位检查均引出典型的N75-Ploo-N135曲线,潜伏期和振幅分别为(41.63±4.89)ms和(9.12±2.97)μv；视神经损伤后1d Ploo波潜伏期延长,波幅降低,与对照组相比有统计学意义(P{\textless}0.05),伤后潜伏期逐步延长,波幅降低。结论应用FPI成功建立兔外伤性视神经病变动物模型,为外伤性视神经病变发病机制的相关研究奠定良好基础。
二、晶状体损伤促进兔外伤性视神经病变RGCs轴突再生作用及机制
目的探讨晶状体损伤促进外伤性视神经病变RGCs轴突再生的作用及机制。方法选取128只中国白兔作为实验动物,随机分为实验组和对照组,每组各64只,每组按照不同观察时间点(1、2、4、7、10、14、21、28d)分为8个亚组。每亚组8只。应用FPI建立右眼外伤性视神经病变模型,实验组损伤右眼晶状体,对照组不损伤右眼晶状体。于损伤前及损伤后1、2、4、7、10、14、21、28d行F-VEP检查并进行比较,并于上述各时间点制作视网膜切片,采用免疫组织化学法检测视网膜中巨噬细胞的数量,用焦油紫染色标记存活的视网膜神经节细胞(RGCs),对存活的RGCs进行计数。结果实验组,视神经损伤后1天,F-VEP主波P100潜伏期延长,振幅降低,10天时潜伏期最长,随后潜伏期逐渐缩短,振幅7天时最低,随后振幅逐渐升高；在对照组,视神经损伤后P100潜伏期逐渐延长,振幅逐渐降低。在实验组,铁染色标记阳性的活化巨噬细胞在在视神经损伤后4天视网膜内检测到,轴突再生的RGCs损伤后7天检测；而在对照组,始终没有检测到铁染色标记阳性的活化巨噬细胞和轴突再生的RGCs。结论晶状体损伤可促进外伤性视神经病变RGCs轴突再生,活化的巨噬细胞在其中起着重要作用。
三、Z-DEVD-FMK对兔外伤性视神经病变RGCs的保护作用
目的观察Z-DEVD-FMK对免外伤性视神经病变视网膜神经节细胞的保护作用。方法健康中国白兔104只,随机选取8只兔作为空白对照组(N组),其余96只作为实验组,分为玻璃体腔注射组和眼周注射组,每组48只。玻璃体腔注射组中兔右眼注射Z-DEVD-FMK (A组),左眼注射DMSO液(B组)。眼周注射组中免右眼注射Z-DEVD-FMK (C组),左眼注射DMSO液(D组)。每组又根据给药后1d、4d、7d、10d、14d、21d观察时间点分为六个亚组,每个亚组8只眼。应用液压冲击颅脑损伤仪(fluid percussion brain injury device, FPI)建立兔外伤性视神经病变动物模型,分别于损伤后第1d、4d、7d、10d、14d、21d行F-VEP检查,TUNEL法检测RGCs凋亡。结果(1) F-VEP:给药后第7d、第10d、第14d和第21d,A组和C组的PIoo潜伏期逐渐缩短,振幅逐渐升高。与B组和D组相比均具有统计学意义(p{\textless}0.05)。A组和C组主波潜伏期在给药后第4d虽然仍在延长,但与B组和D组比较差异有统计学意义(P{\textless}0.05),A组伤后第21天的潜伏期和振幅分别为(64.46±5.92)ms和(6.61±2.61)μv,C组分别为(71.06±5.57)ms和(5.91±1.64)μv,两组比较差异有统计学意义(P{\textless}0.05)。空白对照组潜伏期和振幅与其他各组相应时间点比较,差异均有统计学意义(P{\textless}0.05)。(2)TUNEL染色及RGCs凋亡率：C组和D组在伤后第1天TUNEL染色可见凋亡细胞,第4天明显增多,至第7天达高峰。A组和C组在伤后第4天至第10天仅可见少量凋亡细胞,在第4天-第21天,与B组、D组比较,RGCs凋亡率明显减少。结论Caspase-3抑制剂Z-DEVD-FMK能有效地抑制视神经损伤后神经节细胞的凋亡,在一定程度上促进视功能修复。Z-DEVD-FMK玻璃体腔注射比球周注射作用更加持久。},

	abstract = {目的:通过头穴电刺激联合体针治疗急性期重度Bell麻痹的临床研究,评价头穴对Bell麻痹的临床疗效及安全性,为临床提供一种疗效确切、利于推广的针灸治疗方法。
方法:将入选的70例患者随机分为头穴电刺激联合体针组(治疗组)和体针组(对照组),每组各35例。
处理措施:治疗组:体针取穴:患侧阳白、四白、攒竹、丝竹空、颧髎、下关、迎香、地仓、颊车、夹承浆、翳风、风池,双侧合谷、太冲;头穴取双侧顶颞前斜线下2/5及颞前线。刺灸法:发病一周内面部穴浅刺0.1-0.2寸,轻刺激,平补平泻,合谷、太冲穴直刺1.0寸,用泻法。发病一周后阳白、攒竹、丝竹空、迎香、夹承浆平刺0.5-1寸,四白直刺0.2-0.3寸、颧髎、下关、翳风、风池、合谷、太冲直刺1-1.5寸,地仓穴透颊车穴,平补平泻。头针:常规消毒,快速进针,针体与头皮呈30度左右夹角快速刺入头皮下,当针尖达到帽状腱膜下层时,指下感到阻力减小,然后使针与头皮平行继续进针到相应深度。进针后快速捻转,转数200次/分左右,捻转持续约1分钟,之后连接韩氏穴位神经刺激仪。连接方法:将每对输出电极分别接在同侧顶颞前斜线下2/5和颞前线上。治疗参数:疏密波,频率2/15Hz,强度以针柄轻微颤动,患者能够耐受为度。通电时间30分钟。对照组:体针取穴同治疗组,不加用头针。刺灸法及治疗时间同治疗组。
观察指标:1.面瘫主要症状、体征的变化。参照第五次国际面神经外科专题研究研讨会推荐的House Brackmann(H-B)面神经功能评价分级系统进行评定。2.血常规,分别于疗前、疗程结束后各检测1次。
疗效评定标准:参照第五次国际面神经外科专题研究研讨会推荐的House Brackmann(H-B)面神经功能评价分级系统制定。
结果:1.两组组内比较,各疗程后与治疗前相比,症状、体征评分差异均有统计学意义(P{\textless}0.01),治疗组第三疗程后总有效率为100\%,对照组总有效率为94.29\%;2.治疗后两组比较,第一疗程症状、体征评分差异无统计学意义(P{\textgreater}0.05)。第二和第三疗程两组间差异具有统计学意义(P{\textless}0.01);3.两组在不同疗程,性别与疗效相关性检验均无统计学意义(P{\textgreater}0.05);4.两组在不同疗程,年龄与疗效相关性分析结果表明,治疗组在三个疗程中病情恢复均与年龄相关,相关性检验具有统计学意义,年龄越小恢复效果越好,年龄越大,恢复越差。对照组在第一和第二疗程时病情恢复与年龄相关,相关性检验具有统计学意义,亦表现出年龄越小恢复效果越好,在第三疗程时病情恢复与年龄相关性检验无统计学意义。5.治疗组中,不同病因下显效率由高至低的顺序为:病毒感染(100\%)优于细菌感染(75.0\%)优于不明原因(50.0\%)。对照组中,不同病因下显效率由高至低的顺序为:病毒感染(100\%)优于细菌感染(54.5\%)优于不明原因(42.8\%)。6.对兼症的治疗两组差异无统计学意义。(P{\textgreater}0.05)
结论:1.头穴电刺激联合体针治疗重度Bell麻痹具有较好疗效,其疗效优于体针组;2.头穴电刺激联合体针对于病毒感染的重度Bell麻痹患者治疗效果明显; 3.不同年龄的重度Bell麻痹患者面神经功能恢复情况不同;4.头穴电刺激联合体针治疗重度Bell麻痹安全可靠,操作简便,利于临床推广。},

	abstract = {糖尿病视乳头病变（diabetic papillopathy，DP）和非动脉炎性前部缺血性视神经病变（nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy，NAION）都是与糖尿病存在密切联系的视神经疾病，二者的临床表现有很多相似之处。DP自从被命名以来，与NAION的关系问题就一直成为争论的焦点：部分学者认为DP具有与NAION完全不同的发病病理过程，是一种独立的眼病；而另有学者认为DP也是视盘缺血的一种形式，类似或等同于NAION，只是NAION的临床亚型或轻型。但是目前的这些研究大多是通过对二者临床表现的不同进行观察分析，用以判断二者是否属于同种眼病，并没有能够从发病机制的角度对二者的异同进行论证。本研究根据目前对于DP和NAION发病机制的推测，应用先进的光学相干断层扫描（optical coherence tomography，OCT）、彩色多普勒血流成像（colourDoppler flow imaging，CDFI）、以及糖基化血红蛋白（HbA1c）检测等技术，观察DP和NAION在这些方面的异同之处，以期提高对二者的认知和治疗水平。 	目的：应用OCT、CDFI以及HbA1c检测等技术，从发病机制角度论证DP和NAION在这些方面的异同之处，以期提高对二者的认知和治疗水平。 	方法：对所有入选DP患者19例20眼与NAION患者28例30眼进行视盘水肿OCT特征、黄斑水肿发生率、糖尿病视网膜病变分期以及糖尿病病程的比较。 	对完成CDFI和HbA1c检查的所有DP患者9例10眼与NAION患者10例10眼进行眼球后血流动力学特征和发病近期HbA1c水平的比较。 	结果：1DP组中视盘上方、下方、鼻侧和颞侧四个部分视盘水肿的平均高度无显著性差异（P＞0.05），呈现均衡性水肿；而NAION组中视盘上方、下方、鼻侧和颞侧四个部分视盘水肿的平均高度具有显著性差异（P＜0.05），呈现非均衡性水肿。 	DP组视盘水肿最高点的高度（t=2.199，P=0.033）和视盘中心1mm范围内的平均高度（t=2.629，P=0.011）均显著低于NAION组。 	DP组（45\%）与NAION组（63.3\%）黄斑水肿发生率无统计学显著性差异（P=0.251）。 	2DP组DR发生率75.0\%，其中非增生期93.3\%，增生期6.7\%，无DR25.0\%；NAION组DR发生率43.3\%，其中非增生期61.5\%，增生期38.5\%，无DR56.7\%。 	DP组伴发DR发病率显著高于NAION组（P=0.042），DP组非增生期发病率显著高于增生期（P=0.035），NAION组非增生期与增生期发病率无显著性差异（P=0.695）。 	3DP组患眼的眼动脉收缩期峰值血流速度（P=0.048）和舒张末期血流速度（P=0.026）均显著高于NAION组患眼的数值，两组的阻力指数无显著性差异（P=0.816）。 	DP组患眼的睫状后短动脉收缩期峰值血流速度（P=0.003）和舒张末期血流速度（P=0.002）均显著高于NAION组患眼的数值，DP组患眼的阻力指数显著低于NAION组患眼的数值（P=0.001）。 	DP组患眼的视网膜中央动脉收缩期峰值血流速度（P=0.038）和舒张末期血流速度（P=0.002）显著高于NAION组患眼的数值，DP组患眼的阻力指数显著低于NAION组患眼的数值（P=0.041）。 	4DP组发病近期的HbA1c水平显著高于NAION组（t=-2.36， P=0.030），DP组糖尿病病程显著短于NAION组（z=-2.252，P=0.024）。 	结论： 	1DP与糖尿病引起的视网膜微循环障碍关系密切，NAION与眼球后血管的低灌注关系密切，二者的发病机制存在不同。 	2DP的视盘水肿程度较NAION轻微，而且分布均衡。 	3DP和NAION的发病机制不同，在临床上应该注意区别对待。},

总结缺血性视神经病变综合治疗的临床经验,探索治疗本病的更有效的方法。
方法：
按张承芬教授1998年主编的《眼底病学》中的前段缺血性视神经病变的诊断标准和Hayreh教授2004年主编的《后段缺血性视神经病变》的后段缺血性视神经病变的诊断标准收纳34例(39眼)缺血性视神经病变患者。根据患者病情不同和疾病不同时期采用中医或中西医综合治疗的方法治疗。有激素禁忌症或病程较长、视神经水肿不严重的非血管炎性患者采用以下中医综合治疗：1.辩证治疗：气滞血瘀型治则活血行气法,方用逍遥散加减；气虚血瘀型治则益气活血通络明目,方用补阳还五汤加减；2.低分子右旋糖酐注射液+川芎嗪针静脉滴注；3.复方章柳碱针剂患眼颞侧穴位注射；4.香丹针眼部直流电离子导入；5.针灸。无激素禁忌症、病程较短、视神经水肿严重或血管炎性患者采用中西医综合治疗：病程早期在中医治疗组基础上加用糖皮质激素、降眼压、B族维生素、高压氧等治疗；非血管炎患者病程中、后期治疗同中医治疗组,血管炎性患者中后期激素逐渐减量。观察治疗前后患者的视力、眼底、视野检查结果的特点、改变及疗效；中医综合治疗组与中西医综合治疗组的疗效差别；发病后就诊时间不同的患者的疗效差别。
结果：
1)34例(39)眼缺血性视神经病变患者经综合治疗后,临床治愈11眼(28.21\%),显效10眼(25.64\%),有效12眼(30.77\%),总有效率84.62\%,无效6眼(15.38\%)。2)治疗前后视力差异有统计学意义：治疗后视力较治疗前有明显提高,(x2=78,P{\textless}0.01)。3)治疗后31眼视野有改善(79.49\%),8眼无明显改善(20.51\%)。视野平均缺损(x±s,db)：治疗前21.71±3.25,治疗后12.68±1.54,进行配对t检验,治疗前后差异有统计学意义(t=5.20,P{\textless}0.01)。4)治疗后眼底：16眼视盘外观正常,15眼水肿消退,有不同程度视神经萎缩。5)中医综合治疗组14例(15眼)：临床治愈5眼(33.33\%),显效5眼(33.33\%),有效3眼(20.0\%),总有效率86.67\%,无效2眼(13.33\%)；中西医综合治疗组20例(24眼)：临床治愈6眼(25.0\%),显效5眼(20.83\%),有效9眼(37.50\%),总有效率83.33\%,无效4眼(16.67\%),二者疗效差异无统计学意义(x2=0.79,P{\textgreater}0.01)。6)发病后在15天内就诊20例(22眼)：临床治愈9眼(40.91\%),显效7眼(31.82\%),有效5眼(22.72\%),总有效率95.45\%,无效1眼(4.55\%),发病后在15天以上就诊14例(17眼)：临床治愈2眼(11.76\%),显效3眼(17.65\%),有效7眼(41.18\%),总有效率70.59\%,无效5眼(29.41\%)。二者疗效差异有统计学意义(x2=39,P{\textless}0.01)。
结论：
1.缺血性视神经病变使用综合治疗可有效改善视网膜循环,提高视功能；2.对于不能接受激素治疗或激素治疗无效以及病程较长的缺血性视神经病变患者中医中药综合治疗是一种好的治疗方案；4.对于缺血性视神经病变早期治疗或血管炎引起本病的患者中西医综合治疗是较好的治疗方法；3.早诊断、早治疗是缺血性视神经病变视功能预后的关键性因素。},

	abstract = {目的
本研究主要通过对前部缺血性视神经病变病人的临床总结,以视力、视野及证候改变为主要指标,验证辨证分型用药治疗前部缺血性视神经病变的临床效果。
方法
1.研究对象：以中国中医科学院眼科医院2005年2-2011年5月住院的前部缺血性视神经病变患者为研究对象。
1.1纳入标准：1.符合AION诊断。2.年龄40-70岁。3.中医辨证分别为气滞血瘀型、肝郁气滞型、气虚血瘀型。4.如果选择病例只有一眼符合入选标准,则该眼为实验眼。如果选择病例双眼均符合入选标准,只选择重病眼,即1只眼为1例原则。
1.2排除标准：1.不符合AION病症诊断2.未中止其他相关治疗,可能影响本研究的治疗效应治标观察。3.年龄小于40,或者大于70。4.合并其他眼病。5.合并严重心脑血管、肝、肾和造血系统疾病及精神病患者。6.妊娠期及哺乳期妇女,过敏体质或对本药过敏者。
1.3一般情况
符合纳入标准选择2005年2月到2010年5月选择于我院就诊患者90例(90只眼),所有患者都经过眼科检查、视野、荧光眼血管造影(FFA)及全身系统检查。其中男53例(53只眼),女37例(37只眼)年龄最小40岁,最大68岁,平均年龄54岁。90例患者的分型情况,肝郁气滞型30例,气滞血瘀型35例,气虚血瘀型25例。
1.4辅助检查
视野检查眼底血管荧光造影检查
1.5治疗方案
中医证型及治疗方案。
1.肝郁气滞型证,治宜疏肝解郁,活血清热。采用清肝理气之剂治疗丹栀逍遥散加减(丹皮10g,山栀1Og,柴胡6g,当归12g,白芍l0g,生白术10g,川芎1Og,防风10g,藁本10g,香附10g,茺蔚子10g,等),2.气滞血瘀证,治宜行气活血化瘀。组采用活血通络之剂,桃红四物汤加减治疗(桃仁10g、红花10g、川芎1 Og、当归10g赤芍l 0g、生地l0g、丹参15g、枸杞子15g等)；3.气虚血瘀型证,治以益气养血,活血明目为主。主要是采用补阳还五汤治疗(黄芪30g当归10g桃仁10红花l0g地龙10g川芎l0g赤芍10g菟丝子10g等)。
配合中药注射剂治疗包括(舒血宁注射液、葛根素注射液、疏血通注射液等)。
治疗方案：辨证分为肝郁气滞型,气滞血瘀型,气虚血瘀型分别口服中药汤剂,每日1一剂分两次服。配合活血通络的中药注射剂(舒血宁注射液、葛根素注射液、疏血通注射液)每日一次静点,1o次为一个疗程,3-5天后开始下一疗程,共2个疗程。并同时对症治疗高血压、高血脂、糖尿病等疾病。
1.6疗效评定
根据临床症状及辨证治疗方法,本组病例主要分为3个证型：①肝郁气滞型②气滞血瘀型③气虚血瘀型。以视力及视野的客观检查指标作为疗效观察指标,结合中医证型评价中药治疗前部缺血性视神经病变的效果。来比较治疗前后视力、视野的变化。观察指标：(1)视力；(2)视野的平均光敏感度；(3)视野的平均缺损。疗效评定参照参照《21世纪眼科学前沿》袁佳琴主编(2001)中《关于眼缺血治疗》。项目为视力、视野两项。根据每个项目治疗前后的情况,以五分制给予评分。
结果
本文患者的视力测定均采用标准对数视力表[GB 11533-1989],肝郁气滞型治疗前平均视力0.162±0.089,治疗后平均视力为0.4305±0.320；气滞血瘀型患者治疗前平均视力为0.225±0.153,治疗后平均视力为0.505±0.422；气虚血瘀型患者平均视力0.242±0.165,治疗后平均视力为0.475±0.356。3组治疗前后比较,经过统计学分析,均P{\textless}0.01,有显著统计学意义。见
视野平均敏感度(MS),采用静态阈值检查法测定,就是通过在视野某一点从阈下刺激逐渐增加不动光标的刺激强度,以探测刚可被受检眼看见的光标刺激强度,来代表该视野点的光敏感度或光阈值。视野指数平均缺损(MD)受检眼光敏感度与同年龄正常人光敏感度之差。
经统计学分析,肝郁气滞型治疗前平均敏感度6.22±5.10,治疗后11.49±8.85,气滞血瘀型治疗前7.73±5.86,治疗后14.76±10.3,气虚血瘀型治疗前8.04±6.45,治疗后14.85±11.2；各型治疗前后比较P值均{\textless}0.01,有明显的统计学意义,则3组患者平均光敏感度均有明显改善。肝郁气滞型平均视野缺损度治疗前8.70±4.30,治疗后5.05±2.53,气滞血瘀组治疗前7.30±3.65,治疗后4.34±2.25,气虚血瘀型治疗前6.60±3.24,治疗后4.20±2.20。经过统计学分析,均P{\textless}0.01,差异有统计学意义,视野平均缺损也明显减少。见下表2、3.
经过治疗后,按临床疗效评定标准,3组总有效率分别为90.0\%、83.3\%、80.0\%；90例患者治疗前后效果比较,经过行x列表的X2检验进行统计学分析,肝郁气滞型患者效果明显,P{\textless}0.05。辨证分型治疗有一定的临床价值。具体情况见表4。
针对患者来院就诊时患者的视力情况划分为5组,进行疗效评分统计,0.01以下4例,疗效评分为：1.25±1.82；0.05以下,疗效评分平均为2.05±1.50；0.05-0.1组,疗效评分平均为4.20±2.45；0.2-0.5组,疗效评分平均为6.50±3.60；0.5以上者,疗效评分平均为8.70±3.35。由单一因素方差分析得出,F(24,3)值=10.50,P值{\textless}0.05,表示差异有显著性统计学意义。所以,基础视力情况对疗效有影响,基础视力低者则疗效较差,高者疗效则较好。见表5。
将本课题患者的年龄分为3个年龄段,从统计学结果来看,t值分割上看,{\textless}50岁与50-60岁患者之间疗效比较没有明显差异,P{\textgreater}0.05。{\textless}50岁与50-60岁分别与{\textgreater}60岁者比较,有明显的差异性,F值=2.35,P{\textless}0.05.可以看出疗效结果与年龄有着密切关联,年龄愈小者疗效越好,年老者则疗效欠佳。见表6。
在这90例患者中,以10d、60d为界分为,急性病程{\textless}10d,短期病程10d-60d,慢性病程{\textgreater}60d.从统计结果看出,急性病程患者与短期病程、慢性病程患者有着明显的差异性,而短期病程与慢性病程患者则无明显差异。可以得出早期发作早治疗效果显著。见表7。
从合并症的数目上分析,无合并症患者的疗效较好,并发症多着疗效则较差。见表8
结论：
1中医辨证治疗前部缺血视神经病变有效。本文中肝郁气滞型患者疗效较好。鉴于样本量少,还需按循证医学要求进一步探讨。
2结合病理分期用药,能够针对性的改善器官实质性病变,有助于改善病情,提高疗效。并且急性期是治疗的关键,做到早期治疗,可完全逆转病情。
3中西医结合治疗,使得患者病情及时控制,治疗结果更佳,并提高患者的生活质量。
4本研究不足之处,病例样本有限,分型上也较局限,还需要进一步的临床研究。},

	abstract = {目的
探讨NAION的临床特征,探索其发病危险因素,从而为其早期诊断提供临床依据。
方法
收集2009年1月～2010年12月期间于我院住院并确诊为前部缺血性视神经病变的病例46例(52眼)的临床资料,分析其特点。纳入标准:病史、症状、眼底、视野、FFA结果均符合NAION的诊断标准,临床资料完整。排除标准:确诊或怀疑为巨细胞性动脉炎者。
结果
46例中伴有高血压者21例,脑血管疾病15例,糖尿病14例,吸烟者14例,呈小视盘者3例,动脉硬化3例,白内障术后1例。44眼(84.62\%)眼底出现视盘缺血性水肿,19眼(36.54\%)视野表现为与生理盲点相连的暗点,FFA早期52眼(100\%)表现为视盘全部或部分荧光充盈延迟或缺损,晚期表现各异,P-VEP P100波振幅降低潜伏期轻度延长,颈动脉彩超异常率较高但与NAION的发生无侧向一致性。
结论
非动脉炎性前部缺血性视神经病变是受多因素影响的眼部疾病,而高血压、糖尿病、脑血管疾病等是主要的危险因素,眼底、视野、FFA具有特征性的表现,即与视神经损害部位及范围相对应的视盘苍白区、视野缺损区及FFA荧光缺损或充盈延迟区域,P-VEP及颈动脉彩超在NAION患者中也有明显异常,但其特异性不高,可作为参考指标。充分了解患者局部及全身的危险因素,并将眼底、视野、FFA综合考虑并联合P-VEP及颈动脉彩超检查,对前部缺血性视神经病变的早期诊断具有重要价值。},

	abstract = {目的：前部缺血性视神经病变(Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy，AION)简称缺盘，是临床常见的眼底病，目前对AION的治疗方法虽甚多，但效果并不理想。缺盘是由于视神经前部的视网膜神经节轴索细胞(retinal ganglion cell，RGC)的突然缺血引起的，这也是视神经功能紊乱的主要原因。过去一直没有简便、易得的视神经功能紊乱的动物模型，我们造成AION的动物模型，对这种病的发病机理，发病因素进行更详细的研究，依其结果进行中西医结合的临床治疗研究，对探寻一种简便、有效的治疗缺盘的方法有着积极意义。     方法：我们用较新颖的光动力方法制作出一种缺盘的鼠模型(rat model of AION，rAION)。将30只实验性SD大鼠随机分为4组，分别为空白对照组5例、激光组5例、光敏剂组5例、光动力模型组15例。动物均取右眼为实验眼，左眼为自身对照眼。光动力模型组从鼠尾静脉注入血卟啉衍生物(hematoporphyrin derivative，HPD)后，立即用氪红光647nm、80mw、投照占2／3视盘为准的光斑，持续照射鼠视盘120秒；激光组单纯用氪红光647nm、80mw、投照占2／3视盘为准的光斑，持续照射鼠视盘120秒；光敏剂组单纯从鼠尾静脉注入HPD；空白对照组未做任何处理。通过与对照组的比较，我们能够确定是光化学作用，而不是热损伤或光敏剂对细胞的毒性作用导致的视神经缺血，这种模型相似于人类的缺盘。用这种方法制作rAION模型，没有明显地损伤视网膜，也没有破坏视网膜下面的结构，使我们能很好的了解活体上RGC及视神经的反应。通过眼底荧光血管造影、组织学、视电生理等方法，我们可以描述同单个RGC轴索缺血相联系的早期改变的特征。     结果：眼底：光动力模型组，造模后第1天，视盘上半水肿，边界不清；造模后第6天，视盘仍水肿；造模后第90天，视盘上半萎缩，色灰白。FFA：光动力模型组造模后半小时，即可见到鼠视盘上部高荧光，该鼠23d后视盘始终低荧光；造模后第1天视盘上部早期“低荧光”、中晚期“高荧光”；造模后第6天视盘上部“低荧光”。视电生理上的改变：在光动力模型组中，实验眼与自身对照眼相比，F-VEP P100的潜伏期延长(n=10，t=3.148，p=0.012)、波幅值降低(n=10，t=4.082，p=0.003)。这种变化从造模后早期一直持续到造模后35天。OCT：光动力模型组造模后第6天，鼠视盘视神经反射面高出视网膜反射面，且表面粗糙不平厚度增加。组织病理学改变：HE},

	abstract = {目的:利用α-糜蛋白酶与卡波姆两组药物制造兔高眼压模型,观察眼压升高程度及眼部反应情况,探讨两组模型作用机制。实验方法:家用灰兔20只(雌雄不限,体重2.5-3.5公斤)随机分成两组。第一组:右眼角膜缘12点位前房穿刺,先抽出房水0.1-0.2ml.α-糜蛋白酶约85U(0.15ml)自穿刺口经瞳孔区注射至后房。第二组:注射药物前操作同第一组。0.3\%卡波姆合0.025\%地塞米松0.1-0.2ml经穿刺口注射至前房。结果:糜蛋白酶所致眼压升高不明显,操作困难,容易发生白内障、虹膜后粘连并发症。卡波姆升高眼压效果明确,最高可达40mmHg.此高眼压状态可维持30天左右,在眼压下降后约15天还可再次升高。卡波姆注射后,兔眼局部炎症反应较重,可致球结膜充血,角膜混浊、水肿、扩张,瞳孔强直,甚至发生角巩膜缘破裂。结论:卡波姆是制造兔慢性高眼压模型的有效方法。卡波姆模型对眼球后节无明显毒副作用,可尝试用来做高眼压视神经萎缩方面的实验研究。},

	abstract = {临床研究一、非动脉炎性前部缺血性视神经病变(AION)患者流行病学及眼血流动力学特征分析
目的：通过回顾分析既往病历资料获得AION的临床流行病学资料。方法：选择2010年1月至2013年12月我院眼科住院的AION患者108例,将病历中的相关资料填写入预先设计好的电子表格中后进行统计学分析。结果：纳入研究的AION患者中,男57例(52.8\%),女51例(47.2\%),平均年龄57.23±11.95岁,单眼发病50例(46.3\%),双眼发病58例(53.7\%),两眼平均间隔时间为15.3±25.1m；72例(66.7\%)患者能描述确切的发病时间,其中61例(56.5\%)为突然发病,78例(72.2\%)否认存在诱发因素,66例(61.1\%)患者有高血压.高血脂、糖尿病、心脏病、脑梗塞或者颈椎病病史,62例(57.4\%)早期就诊患者被诊断为AION,45例(41.7\%)早期给予了糖皮质激素治疗；来我院就诊时患眼的平均病程为21.2±51.1m,平均视力为：0.35±0.36,平均眼压为15.0±2.8mmHg;166眼中,138眼曾进行视野检查,最常见的视野缺损类型为下方半盲(18.8\%)、中央管状或者近管状视野(14.5\%)、扇形视野缺损(10.9\%)；55例住院期间接受了影像学检查,36例(65.5\%)患者发现缺血、梗塞、脱髓鞘等异常病灶,62例患者接受了眼动脉彩超检查,27例发现动脉硬化、流速减低等异常,,47例住院期间接受了颈动脉彩超检查,其中29例(61.7\%)检出颈动脉硬化、狭窄或者斑块,患者心率74.7±6.8次/分,收缩压为124.8±15.1mmHg,舒张压为77.9±8.7mmHg,29例(26.9\%)血压高于正常值；患者的血生化指标中,静脉血糖、总胆固醇、甘油三酯、低密度脂蛋白胆固醇偏高的比例分别为：23.5\%、26.3\%、40.4\%及31.6\%；患者最常见的异常刻下症为眠差(22\%),典型的舌象为舌质淡红或者暗红、苔薄白或者少苔,典型的脉象为弦脉或者细脉,最常见的证侯特点为气虚血瘀、气滞血瘀、气血两虚及肝郁气滞,银杏叶提取物、灯盏花素、川芎嗪的使用频率最高的中药注射剂。结论：AION具有较典型的流行病学特征,这些特点可对提高对疾病的认识、为疾病的预防乃至治疗策略提供一定的参考价值。
临床研究二、活血化瘀治疗对AION患者眼血流动力学的影响
目的：研究活血化瘀中药治疗对AION患者血流动力学的影响。方法：回顾性分析AION病例22例33眼,患者均给予活血化瘀中药治疗14天以上,治疗前后均接受眼部血管的彩色多普勒超声血管检查,测量眼动脉、视网膜中央动脉、鼻侧睫状后短动脉的收缩期峰值血流速度(peak systolic velocit, PSV)、阻力指数(resistance index, RI),并对眼动脉的直径进行测量,同时记录患者治疗前后最佳矫正视力、视野等.结果：患者平均治疗23.7±8.2天,治疗前后的视力分别为：3.67+1.32及3.91±1.18,经比较差异具有统计学意义(t=-2.328,P=0.039),治疗前后视野MS分别为12.93±6.27及13.37±5.49dB,经比较差异不显著(t=-1.361,P=0.198)；治疗前后眼动脉内径、PSV、RI,视网膜中央动脉PSV、RI,睫状后短动脉PSV、RI等均无显著差异(P均{\textgreater}0.05)。结论：本研究纳入的22例AION患者33眼经治疗后视力、视野有所改善,但活血化瘀药物治疗未能改善眼动脉、视网膜中央动脉、睫状后短动脉的血流动力学指标。
临床研究三、活血化瘀中药制剂治疗AION患者的疗效评价
目的：评价活血化瘀中药制剂银杏叶提取物、灯盏花素注射液用于治疗AION的疗效。方法：选取我院住院治疗的AION患者50例,随机分组为三组,均给予针灸、复方樟柳碱穴位注射等基础治疗,银杏叶提取物组(A组)增加银杏叶提取物注射液87.5mg Qd静点,灯盏花素组(B组)增加灯盏花素注射液100ml Qd静点,对照组(C组)不予中药注射剂治疗,各组均连续治疗2周,以治疗前后患者最佳矫正视力、视野平均敏感度的改变作为疗效评价依据。结果：各组治疗前一般资料无统计学差异,三组患者治疗后视力均高于治疗前,其中银杏叶组视力改善幅度最大,灯盏花素组和银杏叶组治疗前后视力比较均具有显著差异(P{\textless}0.05),对照组治疗前后视力比较差异不明显(P{\textgreater}0.05),三组患者治疗后视力改善幅度之间无显著差异(P{\textgreater}0.05),灯盏花素组和银杏叶组治疗后MS高于治疗前,其中灯盏花素组治疗后视野改善幅度最大,治疗前后比较差异具有显著差异(P{\textless}0.05),而对照组治疗后MS反而有所减少,但差异不明显(P{\textgreater}0.05)；按照人数计算总有效率,灯盏花素组和银杏叶组有效率均为65\%,对照组有效率仅为40\%,组间比较均无统计学差异,按照眼数计算有效率,灯盏花素组有效率为46.7\%,银杏叶组有效率为45.2\%,对照组有效率仅为26.7\%,组间比较均无统计学差异。结论：灯盏花素、银杏叶提取物参与治疗AION的疗效相当,均略高于对照组,活血化瘀中药在AION的治疗中有较好的应用前景,但目前尚无足够证据证实灯盏花素、银杏叶提取物的确切疗效。},

	abstract = {目的：非动脉炎性前部缺血性视神经病变（nonarteritic anteriorischemic optic neuropathy，NAION）是引起中老年人视功能严重损害的最常见视神经疾病。目前对NAION的发病机制尚未完全清楚。近年来眼科学者对NAION提出了较多的治疗方法，但效果并不理想。因此NAION的实验研究成为该病预防和治疗的方向，而建立较为理想的实验动物模型已成为研究重点。本研究利用光动力的方法建立在病理生理机制和发病过程上类似于人类NAION的大鼠模型，为深入研究其发病机制，选择临床预防和治疗方案提供研究基础。 	方法：将40只SD大鼠随机分为4组，分别为光动力模型组25只，单纯激光组5只，单纯光敏剂组5只，空白对照组5只，每组随机编号。所有实验动物均取右眼为实验眼，左眼为自身对照。光动力模型组：从鼠尾静脉注入孟加拉玫瑰红(rose Bengal, RB)2.5mmol/(l·kg)立即用532nm绿光、功率75mW、500μm光斑直径照射视盘中上2/3区域18秒。单纯激光组：用532nm绿光、功率75mW、500μm光斑照射视盘中上2/3区域18秒。单纯光敏剂组：从鼠尾静脉注入孟加拉玫瑰红2.5mmol/(l·kg)。空白对照组：不做任何处理。实验各组均于造模前、造模后第1、3、5、7、14、21、28天，进行眼底照相、FFA、OCT检查，观察并记录眼底尤其是视盘的变化。造模后第1、7、14、21、28天进行F-VEP检查，并于各时间点处死大鼠，摘除眼球，选取视神经及其周围视网膜组织进行常规HE染色及扫描电镜观察。 	结果：眼底检查及眼底照相：模型组造模后第1天，视盘上半水肿，边界不清；造模后第5天视盘水肿明显减轻；造模后第7天水肿基本消退；造模后28天视盘色灰白，显示视神经萎缩。FFA:造模后第1天早期视盘上方低荧光，中、晚期视盘上方强荧光；造模后第7天无明显的荧光渗漏，视盘上方低荧光；造模后28天视盘持续低荧光。OCT：造模后第1天视盘及盘周网膜水肿；造模后28天视盘及盘周网膜水肿消退，视盘反射面较正常眼略低，提示视神经萎缩。F-VEP：模型组造模后实验眼与对照眼相比，P2潜伏期延长（t=5.429,p=0.000），振幅降低(t=3.591,p=0.006)。该变化在造模后一直存在。组织病理学：HE染色后光镜下观察，造模后第1天视盘及盘周神经纤维水肿，组织比较疏松；造模后7-21天视盘水肿消退，盘周神经纤维层扁平，视网膜神经节细胞排列疏松，数目减少，可见较长片段的视网膜神经节细胞缺失，内核层细胞核排列紊乱；造模后28天视盘及盘周神经纤维层明显变薄，视网膜切片可见神经节细胞核之间间隙增大，数目明显减少，内核层细胞核排列紊乱，轻度变薄。电镜检查可见造模后1天盘周视网膜神经节细胞体积变大，核空泡变性，胞质内线粒体空泡变性，粗面内质网扩张，内核层及内网状层也均可见水肿改变；造模后28天可见视网膜神经节细胞核固缩，核膜溶解，胞浆内高尔基体扩张。激光组、光敏剂组及空白对照组均无以上变化。 	结论：应用孟加拉玫瑰红联合激光光动力方法诱导的大鼠的NAION模型稳定、成功、可靠，在病理生理机制和发病过程上类似于人的NAION。此模型是较为理想的，可以为NAION的相关基础研究提供很大的帮助，可以据此评价现在正在使用的治疗药物和提出新的NAION治疗方案。},

与临床的相关研究。
方法:2011年3月-2012年9月期间来我科门诊就诊，并确诊为NAION的住院患者纳为病例组。并将同一时期来我院参加门诊体检并与病例组年龄、性别相匹配的人群作为对照组。
1).将纳入对象的个人资料进行详细登记。
2).对纳入对象进行详尽的眼科检查。
3).对纳入对象进行血压监测及血常规、血脂、血糖、血液流变学等化验检查,并将观察指标详细记录；
结果：1).NAION组与对照组之间总胆固醇、HDL-脂蛋白、血常规无显著性差异(P＞0.05)，而甘油三脂、血糖、血压有显著性差异(P＜0.05)，NAION组较高。
2).全血粘度高切、血浆粘度、全血还原粘度中切、红细胞变形指数、血沉、血沉方程K值二组之间无显著性差异(P＞0.05),而全血黏度中低切、红细胞压积、全血还原粘度高低切、红细胞聚集指数有显著性差异(P＜0.05),NAION组较高。
结论：1).高海拔地区NAION的发病因素不是单一的,是多因素相互作用的结结果。
2).高海拔低压低氧等环境条件下，NAION的发病与人体微循环发生的一系列病理生理变化相关。
3).甘油三脂、血压、血糖对高海拔地区NAION的发生具有统计学意义。
4).高血粘度是高海拔地区NAION的发生的危险因素。
5).加强高海拔地区人群对NAION的健康教育，提高其对NAION防治的认识。},

	abstract = {Aim: To evaluate newly diagnosed non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION) patients for the existence of an associated sleep apnoea syndrome. Methods: Newly identified NAION patient underwent polysomnography. The prevalence of sleep apnoea in NAION patients was compared to the prevalence previously found in the general population. Hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and atheromatous lesions of carotid vessels as classic risk factors associated with NAION were also identified. Results: 27 consecutive newly diagnosed NAION patients (18 men and nine women, mean age 65 (SD 8) years, body mass index 27.2 (3.8) kg/m2) were included in the study. 24 of these 27 NAION patients (89\%) exhibited a sleep apnoea syndrome (respiratory disturbance index: 37.2/h (SD18.3/h). Risk ratio for a NAION patient to have sleep apnoea was 4.9 compared to the general population (p{\textless} 0.001). Sleep apnoea was 1.5-2 fold more frequent than the rate of the other identified risk factors typically associated with NAION (hypertension, diabetes). Conclusions: Sleep apnoea is the most frequent disorder associated with NAION and should be screened in this population. At least a questionnaire related to obstructive sleep apnoea symptoms and assessment of sleepiness should be systematically proposed to patients with NAION.},

	abstract = {非动脉炎性前部缺血性视神经病变(nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, NAION)是50岁以上中老年人最常见的急性视神经病变,是神经眼科学领域研究的热点。人们普遍认为梗死区位于睫状后短动脉供应的视乳头筛板区和筛板后区,而睫状后短动脉来自于颈内动脉的分支。目前NAION的病因学和病理生理机制还不很清楚,治疗效果也有限。目前国内外对颈动脉病变与NAION发生之间关系临床研究较少,且二者之间的关系尚不十分明了。
目的
1.观察NAION患者的颈动脉粥样硬化情况和颈动脉血流动力学参数,探讨颈动脉病变与NAION的关系;
2.测定NAION患者各项心血管危险因素,了解这些因素对NAION患者的影响,为治疗和预防提供客观依据。
方法
确诊为NAION的住院患者30例(34眼)和与年龄相匹配的单纯性白内障患者或全身检查正常的非NAION患者30例(30眼)对照进行颈部血管彩色多普勒超声检查,观察颈动脉粥样硬化情况,测量颈动脉血流动力学参数,并测定患者心血管危险因素(包括血压、血糖、血脂、同型半胱氨酸等)。
所得数据使用SPSS16.0软件进行统计学处理,对两组颈动脉内-中膜增厚、粥样硬化斑块之间的比较采用χ2检验;对两组颈动脉狭窄之间的比较采用Fisher确切概率法;对两组颈内动脉阻力指数、颈内动脉内径、总胆固醇、甘油三脂、低密度脂蛋白胆固醇、高密度脂蛋白胆固醇之间的比较采用两样本t检验;P{\textless}0.05表示差异具有统计学意义。
结果
1. NAION组中,26眼(76.47\%)伴有同侧颈动脉粥样硬化病变;对照组中,12眼(40.00\%)有同侧颈动脉粥样硬化病变。颈动脉内-中膜增厚、粥样硬化斑块,在NAION组分别为26眼(76.47\%)、18眼(52.94\%),对照组中分别为12眼(40.00\%)、7眼(23.33\%),两组比较差异具有统计学意义(χ{\textasciitilde}2=8.788,5.869;P=0.003,0.015)。
颈动脉狭窄在NAION组有2眼(5.88\%),对照组未见颈动脉狭窄,两者比较差异不具有统计学意义(P=0.494)。颈内动脉血流阻力指数在NAION组为0.595±0.053,对照组为0.594±0.048,两组比较差异不具有统计学意义(t=0.101,P=0.608)。颈内动脉内径在NAION组为(4.871±0.756)mm,对照组为(5.127±0.657)mm,两组比较差异不具有统计学意义(t=1.375,P=0.509)。
2. NAION组患者伴有高脂血症者14例(46.67\%);伴有高血压病者6例(20.00\%);伴有2型糖尿病者8例(26.67\%)。12例接受血浆同型半胱氨酸检测的患者中,伴有高同型半胱氨酸血症者8例(66.67\%)。不伴有高血压病、2型糖尿病、高脂血症、高同型半胱氨酸血症等全身疾病者8例,占该组患者的26.67\%。
NAION组患者血浆中总胆固醇为(4.71±1.11)mmol/L、甘油三酯为(1.98±1.01)mmol/L、低密度脂蛋白胆固醇为(2.75±0.81)mmol/L,对照组上述检测指标分别为(3.88±0.70)mmol/L、(1.55±0.54)mmol/L、(2.32±0.57)mmol/L,两组比较差异具有统计学意义(t=3.468,2.027, 2.342;P =0.047,0.021,0.045)。NAION组患者高密度脂蛋白胆固醇为(1.05±0.20)mmol/L,对照组为(1.12±0.22)mmol/L,两组比较差异不具有统计学意义(t=1.291,P =0.377)。
结论
1.颈动脉内-中膜增厚、颈动脉粥样硬化斑块与NAION的发病有一定关系,该项研究在国内未见类似报道。颈动脉彩色多普勒超声为NAION诊断提供了一定的依据。
2.心血管危险因素与NAION的发病密切相关,临床防治时应采取相应措施。},

	abstract = {Aim: To determine the association between Viagra (sildenafil)-and Cialis (tadalafil) and non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION).Methods: A retrospective matched case control study was conducted. 38 cases of NAION in males were identified from an academic ophthalmology practice in Birmingham, Alabama, and matched (on age) to 38 controls without a history of NAION. Self reported information regarding past and current use of Viagra and/or Cialis was obtained via a telephone questionnaire from interviewers who were not blind to case status. Results: Overall, males with NAION were no more likely to report a history of Viagra or Cialis use compared to similarly aged controls (odd ratio (OR) 1.75, 95\%confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 6.30 and OR 1.82, 95\%CI 0.21 to 15.39). However, for those with a history of myocardial infarction, a statistically significant association was observed (OR 10.7, 95\%CI 1.3 to 95.8). A similar association was observed for those with a history of hypertension though it lacked statistical significance (OR 6.9, 95\%CI 0.8 to 63.6). Conclusions: For men with a history of myocardial infarction or hypertension the use of Viagra or Cialis may increase the risk of NAION. Physicians prescribing these medications to patients with these conditions should warn them about the potential risk ofNAION.},

	abstract = {目的:通过文献研究和临床观察,针对缺血性视神经病变的病机特点,确立以调肝开窍为主的治疗方法,并探讨其临床疗效,为缺血性视神经病变的治疗提供新思路。
方法:文献研究通过对中医经典文献和现代研究成果的深入挖掘,分别阐述中西医对缺血性视神经病变病因、发病机制及治疗思路与原则的认识。临床研究完成了对自2007年1月至2008年12月山东中医药大学附属医院眼科门诊及病房,符合诊断标准的38例(45眼)NAION患者治疗及疗效观察。遵循简单随机对照原则,将上述病例分为两组:治疗组和对照组。对照组19例(23眼)采用常规治疗,静脉注射川芎嗪等改善视网膜循环,配合维生素B族、A T P及神经营养药物等。2周为1个疗程,共1～3个疗程。治疗组19例(22眼)在对照组的基础上,加用以调肝开窍为主的中药汤剂口服,1剂/天,2周为1个疗程,共1～3个疗程。两组病例病变早期,根据病情,必要时给予强的松40～60mg晨起顿服,连用一周后逐渐减量。观察治疗前后视力、视野平均视敏度、平均缺损、血流变和血脂变化。
结果:共纳入缺血性视神经病变患者38例(45眼),分别与治疗前相比较,两组治疗后视力、视野平均视敏度、平均缺损均具有显著性差异(P{\textless}0.05),治疗组的血流变和血脂具有显著性差异(P{\textless}0.05);同时,两组间治疗后视力、平均视敏感度、平均缺损相比较具有显著性差异(P{\textless}0.05);两组总有效率比较具有显著性差异(P{\textless}0.05)。
结论:调肝开窍法为主治疗缺血性视神经病变,能提高患者的视力、视野平均视敏度,减少视野平均缺损,从而有效地改善患者的视功能。与对照组相比较,能更好的改善患者的血流变和血脂指标和全身状况,有助于缺血性视神经病变的治疗,体现了中医整体观念和标本兼治的思想。},

	abstract = {目的 建立实验性大鼠视神经不同程度不全损伤模型，在此基础上观察重组人睫状神经营养因子对视神经不全损伤后视网膜节细胞的保护作用。
方法 用同一把大号无创血管夹在球后1.5mm处分别钳夹成年大鼠视神经5秒、10秒、20秒、40秒，7天后取材观察不同致伤量对视神经病理、超微结构的影响；钳夹前及钳夹后即时、3天、7天、14天、28天时观察F-VEP变化情况，并以轴突占视神经横截面积的比例和F-VEP恢复程度作为划分损伤程度的标准。
以大鼠视神经中度损伤为模型，实验组伤后即时、7天、14天、28天时玻璃体腔内注射rhCNTF 溶液2μl (1μg/μl)，对照组注射等量蒸馏水（rhCNTF溶剂）。伤后7天、14天、28天、56天取材检测。1.取材前48小时每组部分大鼠用粒蓝逆行标记RGCs，48小时后取视网膜荧光显微镜下观察、计数RGCs密度。2.用RT-PCR方法检测、观察rhCNTF对视网膜组织表达GAP-43mRNA 影响。3.用免疫组化方法检测、观察rhCNTF对视网膜组织GAP-43、GFAP蛋白表达的影响。
结果
1、以大号无创血管夹钳夹视神经不同时间，可以造成视神经轻，中，重度不全损伤。
2、轻度损伤（5秒）后7天轴突占视神经横截面积比例为74.11\%，F-VEP潜伏期恢复正常，伤后28天时振幅恢复至正常的70.00\%；中度损伤（10秒）后7天轴突所占面积比例约等于54.71\%， F-VEP潜伏期恢复正常，伤后28天时振幅恢复到正常的33.99\%；重度损伤（20秒、40秒）后7天轴突占面积比例为30.80\%-15.14\%，伤后28天F-VEP潜伏期仍未恢复正常，振幅只恢复到正常的31.04\%-22.58\%。
3、rhCNTF可以促进中度视神经不全损伤后RGCs的存活。实验组伤后7天、14天、28天、56天时RGCs存活率分别为70.18\%、53.09\%、37.30\%、23.97\%；对照组分别为42.25\%、31.61\%、14.92\%、8.51\%。伤后7天、14天实验组和对照组相比有非常显著差异(p{\textless}0.01)，伤后28天、56天两组间有显著差异（p{\textless}0.05）。
4、免疫组化结果显示伤后7天两组间GAP-43表达差异不明显，伤后14天、28天、56天实验组GAP-43表达呈强阳性，对照组表达呈弱阳性。伤后7天、14天、28天、56天实验组GFAP蛋白表达强于对照组。
{\textless}WP=7{\textgreater}
5、RT-PCR结果显示，伤后7天两组GAP-43mRNA表达都较弱,两组之间差异不明显，伤后14天、28天GAP-43mRNA在视网膜组织表达呈强阳性，对照组表达呈弱阳性,两组间表达差异明显。伤后56天实验组GAP-43mRNA仍较高,对照组表达微弱。
结论：
1、用大号无创血管夹于球后1.5mm处钳夹视神经5秒，可以造成视神经轻度不全损伤；钳夹10秒造成中度不全损伤；钳夹大于20秒造成视神经重度不全损伤。其中视神经中度不全损伤比较适合用于研究各种干预因素对视神经损伤后神经保护与修复的作用。
2、rhCNTF玻璃体腔内重复注射可以促进视神经中度不全损伤后RGCs的长期存活，对RGCs起到保护作用；并且可以促进视神经中度不全损伤后视网膜组织GAP-43mRNA、GAP-43蛋白的表达，可能在视神经损伤后的再生、修复中起重要作用。
3、rhCNTF玻璃体腔内重复注射可以促进视网膜组织GFAP蛋白的表达，提示rhCNTF可能也通过间接的途径对RGCs起保护作用},

1、建立大鼠前部缺血性视神经病变(anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, AION)模型。
2、探讨AION模型大鼠视神经损伤随时间的动态变化趋势。
3、初步了解外源性神经生长因子(nerve growth factor, NGF)对AION模型大鼠视神经损伤的影响。
方法
1、应用光动力方法制备大鼠AION模型(倍频532nm激光,孟加拉玫瑰红作为光敏剂),以右眼为实验眼(n=23)；单纯激光组大鼠不注射光敏剂、仅激光照射右眼视盘(11=11)；正常对照组大鼠无任何处理(n=13)。借助眼底镜检查、眼底荧光素血管造影,观察AION模型大鼠眼底形态变化；通过HE染色、透射电镜检查,观察大鼠视神经及视网膜的组织病理学表现；采用经上丘荧光金逆行标记法,了解AION导致的RGCs损伤的分布特点。
2、将大鼠随机分为5组：正常对照组(n=10)、模型1周组(n=12)、2周组(n=13)、4周组(n=15)及8周组(n=15)。借助经上丘荧光金逆行标记法、HE染色技术,观察AION模型建立1周、2周、4周、8周后大鼠RGCs的密度及存活率的变化。同时,通过大鼠视神经半薄切片甲苯胺蓝染色,了解不同时间点视神经轴突损伤情况。
3、将大鼠随机分为3组：NGF干预组(n=10)、生理盐水组(n=10)、未干预模型组(n=8)。NGF干预组大鼠分别于损伤后12小时、4天、10天,玻璃体腔注射外源性NGF (2μg/4μL);生理盐水组大鼠在相同时间点玻璃体腔注射等量生理盐水；未干预组大鼠在损伤后不做其他处理。比较4周后各组大鼠的RGCs存活情况及视神经轴突损害的程度。
结果
1、大鼠AION模型建立后,第3天视盘明显水肿,1周后视盘水肿基本消退。眼底荧光素血管造影早期视盘、脉络膜局灶性充盈不良。视神经纵切片HE染色显示模型建立后第3天大鼠视神经水肿、空泡变性,视盘周围局限性视网膜脱离；4周后视神经萎缩,细胞增生明显。电镜下可见第3天模型组大鼠视神经轴突肿胀,部分髓鞘解体；4周后,轴突明显丢失,伴反应性胶质化。视网膜切片HE染色示4周后神经纤维层明显变薄、RGCs凋亡,而视网膜内、外核层无明显变化。荧光金逆行标记显示模型组大鼠RGCs密度明显降低；RGCs损伤呈区域性,以激光照射区附近为重。
2、正常对照组大鼠与AION模型1周组、2周组、4周组及8周组右眼RGCs密度分别为2273±219个/mm2,2075±120个/mm2,1783±143个/mm2,1330±169个/mm2,869±301个/mm2,组间比较显示各组RGCs密度之间的差异均有统计学意义(P{\textless}0.05)。上述五组大鼠RGCs存活率分别为99.99\%±3.4\%,91.8\%±2.9\%,72.6\%±5.7\%,54.4\%±7.0\%,37.5\%±13.0\%,组间比较显示各组RGCs存活率之间的差异均有统计学意义(P{\textless}0.05)。缺血损伤后2周内大鼠RGCs存活率下降相对缓慢；之后RGCs存活率迅速降低,此过程至少持续到第8周。甲苯胺蓝染色显示AION损伤1周后,大鼠视神经即有明显轴突丢失,并逐渐进展；轴突损害以视神经中央部为重；晚期视神经胶质瘢痕明显。
3、NGF干预组大鼠RGCs密度大于生理盐水组及未干预模型组(1447±70个/mm2vs.1298±97个/mm2,1447±70个/mm2vs.1313±153个/mm2；P{\textless}0.05)。NGF干预组大鼠RGCs的存活率也明显高于生理盐水组及未干预模型组(62.0\%±2.8\%vs.53.3\%±5.1\%,62.0\%±2.8\%vs.52.3\%±7.9\%;P{\textless}0.05)。NGF干预组大鼠视神经存在明显的轴突丢失及反应性胶质增生。
结论
1、本实验制备的大鼠AION模型与人眼非动脉炎性前部缺血性视神经病变在形态学及组织病理学改变方面有一定的相似性,可以用于后续实验。
2、AION模型大鼠RGCs的损伤相对滞后,并且持续时间长。这期间是神经保护干预的良好时机,有利于挽救有潜在损伤的RGCs。
3、初步研究显示玻璃体腔注射外源性NGF有一定的神经保护作用。},

Rose bengal dye was injected intravenously; then the retina was exposed to intense light which caused vascular photothrombosis resulting in acute degeneration of retinal neurons. By either light or electron microscopical criteria, the acute neurodegernative reaction was judged identical in pattern, cytopathological appearance, and time course to the excitotoxic type of reaction typically seen in the retina following exposure to exogenous glutamate. These results reinforce other accumulating evidence suggesting that ischemic CNS damage is mediated by glutamate or related excitotoxins. The advantages of this model of CNS ischemia include its noninvasiveness, ease of application, authentic simulation of vascular thrombosis, and accessibility for application of neuroprotective drugs.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate longitudinally the optic disk morphology of nonglaucomatous optic nerve damage secondary to retinal nerve fiber damage, using experimental central retinal artery occlusion in rhesus monkey eyes as a model.
METHODS: This prospective study included 24 eyes of 16 monkeys. In eight eyes of eight animals, central retinal artery occlusion was produced by clamping the central retinal artery in the retrobulbar space. Occlusion was verified by fluorescein fundus angiography. The same eyes at baseline as well as the eight contralateral healthy eyes and eight monkey eyes with experimental high-pressure glaucoma served as control groups. Serially taken optic disk photographs were morphometrically evaluated.
RESULTS: The area and shape of the neuroretinal rim and alpha zone and beta zone of parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy of eyes after central retinal artery occlusion did not vary significantly (P {\textgreater} .30) from the same eyes before central retinal artery occlusion nor from the normal contralateral eyes. In the glaucomatous eyes, the neuroretinal rim was significantly (P {\textless} .001) smaller and parapapillary atrophy significantly (P = .01) larger than in the eyes after central retinal artery occlusion.
CONCLUSIONS: Experimental central retinal artery occlusion, in contrast to glaucoma, does not markedly change the size and shape of parapapillary atrophy and neuroretinal rim; this confirms previous clinical studies. Thus, assessment of parapapillary atrophy and neuroretinal rim may be helpful to differentiate between glaucomatous optic neuropathy and nonglaucomatous optic neuropathy secondary to retinal nerve fiber damage. Parapapillary atrophy is independent of decreased retinal blood perfusion and development of nonglaucomatous optic nerve atrophy following experimental central retinal artery occlusion.},

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD001538.pub4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is characterized by sudden and painless loss of vision in the eye, accompanied by pallid swelling of the optic disc. Its etiology is unknown and no medical therapy has been proven effective in treating this condition. Optic nerve decompression surgery, a proposed treatment for NAION, involves making two or more slits or a window in the tissue surrounding the optic nerve, thereby allowing cerebrospinal fluid to escape, and theoretically reducing the pressure surrounding the optic nerve.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to assess the safety and efficacy of surgery compared with other treatment or no treatment in people with NAION.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2014, Issue 10), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to October 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2014), PubMed (1948 to October 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 23 October 2014.
SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized trials of surgical treatment of NAION were eligible for inclusion in this review.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: From full-text copies of all reports from relevant trials, one author extracted data which were verified by another author. No data synthesis was required.
MAIN RESULTS: The one included trial, in which 258 participants were randomized, was stopped early for futility. At the time of the 24-month report the follow-up rate was 95.3\% for six months and 67.4\% for 24 months (174 participants; 89 careful follow-up and 85 surgery). There was no evidence of a benefit of surgery on visual acuity. Measurements of visual acuity and visual fields were performed by a technician masked to the treatment received. At six months 32.0\% of the surgery group had improved visual acuity by 3 or more lines compared with 42.6\% of the careful follow-up group (unadjusted risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 1.04). At 24 months 29.4\% of the surgery group had improved compared with 31.0\% of the careful follow-up group (unadjusted RR 0.95, 95\% CI 0.60 to 1.49). Participants who underwent surgery more often lost 3 or more lines of visual acuity in the study eye, although the increased risk was not statistically significant. At six months 18.9\% in the surgery group had worsened visual acuity in the study eye compared with 14.8\% in the careful follow-up group (RR 1.28; 95\% CI 0.73 to 2.24). At 24 months 20.0\% in the surgery group had worsened visual acuity in the study eye compared with 21.8\% in the careful follow-up group (RR 0.92; 95\% CI 0.51 to 1.64). Participants who received surgery experienced both intraoperative and postoperative adverse events, including central retinal artery occlusion during surgery and light perception vision at six months (one participant); and immediate loss of light perception following surgery and loss of vision that persisted to the 12-month visit (two participants). In the careful follow-up group, two participants had no light perception at the six-month follow-up visit; one of these had improved to light perception at 12 months. Pain was the most common adverse event in the surgery group (17\% in surgery group versus 3\% in the careful follow-up group at one week). Diplopia (double vision) was the next most common complication (8\% in the surgery group versus 1\% in the careful follow-up group at one week); at three months there was no statistically significant difference in proportion of participants with diplopia between the two groups.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The only eligible trial provided no evidence of a beneficial effect of optic nerve decompression surgery for NAION. Future research should focus on increasing our understanding of the etiology and prognosis of NAION. New treatment options should be examined in the context of randomized clinical trials.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Prostaglandin J₂ (PGJ₂) is neuroprotective in a murine model of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). After assessing for potential toxicity, we evaluated the efficacy of a single intravitreal (IVT) injection of PGJ₂ in a nonhuman primate model of NAION (pNAION).
METHODS: We assessed PGJ₂ toxicity by administering it as a single high-dose intravenous (IV) injection, consecutive daily high-dose IV injections, or a single IVT injection in one eye of five adult rhesus monkeys. To assess efficacy, we induced pNAION in one eye of five adult male rhesus monkeys using a laser-activated rose bengal induction method. We then injected the eye with either PGJ₂ or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) intravitreally immediately or 5 hours post induction. We performed a clinical assessment, optical coherence tomography, electrophysiological testing, fundus photography, and fluorescein angiography in all animals prior to induction and at 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after induction. Following analysis of the first eye, we induced pNAION in the contralateral eye and then injected either PGJ₂ or PBS. We euthanized all animals 5 weeks after final assessment of the fellow eye and performed both immunohistochemical and light and electron microscopic analyses of the retina and optic nerves.
RESULTS: TOXICITY: PGJ₂ caused no permanent systemic toxicity regardless of the amount injected or route of delivery, and there was no evidence of any ocular toxicity with the dose of PGJ₂ used in efficacy studies. Transient reduction in the amplitudes of the visual evoked potentials and the N95 component of the pattern electroretinogram (PERG) occurred after both IV and IVT administration of high doses of PGJ₂; however, the amplitudes returned to normal in all animals within 1 week.
EFFICACY: In all eyes, a single IVT dose of PGJ₂ administered immediately or shortly after induction of pNAION resulted in a significant reduction of clinical, electrophysiological, and histological damage compared with vehicle-injected eyes (P = 0.03 for both VEP and PERG; P = 0.05 for axon counts).
CONCLUSIONS: In nonhuman primates, PGJ₂ administered either intravenously or intravitreally produces no permanent toxicity at even four times the dose given for neuroprotection. Additionally, a single IVT dose of PGJ₂ is neuroprotective when administered up to 5 hours after induction of pNAION.},

	issn = {0002-9394},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: We investigated, in nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, the prevalence of various systemic diseases before or at its onset and the incidence of subsequent morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: We investigated prospectively the presence of systemic diseases before or at the onset of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in 406 patients. The information was obtained by complete medical history and physical examination. The prevalence rates of systemic diseases in young, middle-aged, and elderly groups were compared with those in the general population. We also analyzed the influence of systemic diseases on subsequent morbidity and mortality.
RESULTS: Compared with the prevalences reported in the general population, our patients in each of the three age groups showed a significantly higher prevalence of arterial hypertension (P {\textless} or = .02), diabetes mellitus (P {\textless} .01), and gastrointestinal ulcer (P {\textless} or = .02). Also, middle-aged and elderly patients showed a significantly higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease (P {\textless} .01) and thyroid disease (P {\textless} .01). Middle-aged patients had significantly higher rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cerebrovascular disease (P {\textless} or = .01). After onset of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, patients with both arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus had a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular disease (P {\textless} .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is a multifactorial disease in which some systemic diseases may act as predisposing factors and others as precipitating factors. Patients with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy show no significant increase in mortality, but those with both arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus have significantly (P {\textless} .01) increased incidence of cerebrovascular disease.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is a multifactorial disease, and recently epidemiologic studies have investigated the association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and NAION. A systematic review of the association of OSA and NAION has not been performed. Therefore, the current meta-analysis was performed to assess such potential association between OSA and risk of NAION.
METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE databases was performed for published studies evaluating the association between OSA and NAION. The summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for categorical risk estimates. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were also performed to assess the robustness of pooled outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of four prospective cohort studies and one case-control study met our inclusion criteria. The pooled OR of developing NAION in the subjects with OSA was 6.18 (95\% CI, 2.00-19.11) versus non-OSA controls. Sensitivity analyses showed that no matter one study excluded, the pooled OR did not change significantly, which indicated that the evidence was robust. In subgroup analyses, a significant association was seen in studies matched systemic risk factors (OR, 5.00; 95\% CI, 2.22-11.25), but not in those non-matched. The magnitude and direction of effects were also affected by methodological variability, including study design, and diagnosis of OSA.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this meta-analysis supported the robust evidence that OSA was a strong independent risk factor of NAION. Relative to non-OSA controls, the subjects with OSA were found to have a more than sixfold risk of NAION. In future, more well-designed studies are needed to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A cause and effect relationship between phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5I) use and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) has been hypothesized based on case reports.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Review of literature.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine case reports in the peer-reviewed medical literature have documented a possible relationship between PDE5I consumption and NAION. However, pertinent details, such as the dose and frequency of PDE5I use, and elapsed time between ingestion and onset of vision loss, are lacking from many of these reports. Investigations regarding alterations in ocular perfusion in research subjects who ingested sildenafil have been inconclusive because they have not been performed on subjects with "disc at risk" or risk factors for NAION. One case-crossover study demonstrated a 2-fold increase in risk of NAION after ingestion of PDE5I.
CONCLUSIONS: When a diagnosis of NAION is made, an inquiry should be made as to whether any PDE5I was ingested before the onset of vision loss. If so, the patient should be counseled regarding the possibility that continued PDE5I use may increase the risk of NAION in the fellow eye. Patients with a known history of previous NAION should be cautioned regarding the use of PDE5I for erectile dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension because of the potential increased risk of fellow eye involvement.},

	abstract = {背景外伤性视神经病变是神经眼科常见病,对患者视功能损伤巨大,且预后较差。目前无论是外伤后使用大剂量糖皮质激素冲击治疗或者是视神经管减压术,均缺乏有效证据证实其疗法。目前动物模型也不统一。中医眼科在临床过程中,对外伤性视神经病变积累了大量经验。中医理论认为,外伤性视神经病变属于“撞击暴盲”的范畴,运用重明益损汤治疗外伤性视神经病变在临床上取得了一定疗效。目前基础研究认为,视神经节细胞在凋亡的过程中,有些关键蛋白如Trk家族受体蛋白、p75NTR蛋白等发挥了重要作用。本研究通过横向定量牵拉法牵拉视神经前期研究中发现能造成视网膜神经节细胞凋亡,为了检测分子学凋亡机制,对正常组、对照组和实验组视网膜中p75NTR mRNA.JNK蛋白、p75NTR蛋白和TrkB蛋白的变化进行了测定；对重明益损汤中的主药黄芪对外伤性视神经病变的治疗效果进行了初步探究。目的使用横向定量牵拉法造成大鼠视神经损伤后,测定视网膜内p75NTR mRNA及蛋白的变化,TrkB蛋白的变化,JNK蛋白的变化以及应用黄芪注射液对p75NTR 和 TrkB蛋白表达量的影响。方法1)JNK蛋白的半定量：随机取实验大鼠60只分组,每组30只：A组：横向张力计定量牵拉左眼视神经0.1N×15s,从术后第二日起予生理盐水0.5mL腹腔注射15天；B组：左眼为假手术眼,仅暴露视神经和圈住视神经但不进行牵拉损伤。各组的右眼均不处理。15d后取其视网膜冻存于液氮中,进行JNK蛋白的ELISA法半定量实验。2)p75NTRmRNA的RT-PCR测定：随机取实验大鼠24只分组,每组12只：A组：横向张力计定量牵拉左眼视神经0.1N x 15s,从术后第二日起予生理盐水0.5mL腹腔注射；B组：左眼为假手术眼,仅暴露视神经和圈住视神经但不进行牵拉损伤。各组的右眼均不处理,术后第十五天取左眼视网膜冻存于液氮中,进行对p75NTR的RT-PRC检测。3)随机取实验大鼠90只分组,每组30只：A组：横向张力计定量牵拉左眼视神经0.1N x 15s,从术后第二日起予生理盐水0.5mL腹腔注射；B组：左眼为假手术眼,仅暴露视神经和圈住视神经但不进行牵拉损伤；C组：横向张力计定量牵拉左眼视神经0.1N x 15s,从术后第二日起予黄芪注射液0.5mL腹腔注射。各组的右眼均不处理,作为各组的正常对照眼。15天后取双侧视网膜冻存于液氮中,进行Western Blotting对p75NTR和TrkB蛋白的检测。结果与假手术组相比,手术组视网膜的p75NTR mRNA、JNK蛋白表达量在手术后15d时均上调(p均{\textless}0.05),TrkB蛋白的表达量下调(p{\textless}0.05)对视网膜中p75NTR的表达量的影响未知(p{\textgreater}0.05)；黄芪注射液能轻微提高受损眼的视网膜中TrkB蛋白的表达量(p{\textless}0.05),对视网膜中p75NTR的表达量的影响未知。结论横向牵拉法对视网膜神经节细胞的损伤很明显,可以用其模拟外伤性视神经病变进行后续实验；黄芪注射液对视网膜神经节细胞可能有一定的神经保护作用。},

1960年至1966年间两年一届比赛，受文化大革命影响，1967年至1973年间无比赛。1976年因恰逢毛泽东逝世，仅举行预赛，未举行决赛。},

	doi = {10.1159/000369471},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Flexible bronchoscopy should be performed with a correct posture and a straight scope to optimize bronchoscopy performance and at the same time minimize the risk of work-related injuries and endoscope damage.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test whether an automatic motion analysis system could be used to explore if there is a correlation in scope movements and the operator's level of experience. Our hypothesis was that experienced bronchoscopists move less and keep the flexible scope straighter than less-experienced bronchoscopists while performing procedures.
METHODS: Eleven novices, 9 intermediates and 9 experienced bronchoscopy operators performed 3 procedures each on a bronchoscopy simulator. The Microsoft Kinect system was used to automatically measure the total deviation of the scope from a perfectly straight, vertical line.
RESULTS: The low-cost motion analysis system could measure the accumulated deviation of the scope precisely during the procedure. The deviations were greatest for the novices and smallest for the most experienced operators for all 3 procedures (p = 0.01, p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively). The total deviation from the straight scope correlated negatively with the performance on the simulator (virtual-reality simulator score; p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The motion analysis system could discriminate between different levels of experience. Automatic feedback on correct movements during self-directed training on simulators might help new bronchoscopists learn how to handle the bronchoscope like an expert.},

These CO2-fixing microorganisms have a large, but so far only partially realized, potential for the sustainable production of chemicals and biofuels. Productivities have been improved in autotrophic hosts through the introduction of production pathways and the modification of autotrophic systems by genetic engineering. In addition, approaches are emerging in which CO2 fixation pathways and energy-harvesting systems are transplanted into heterotrophic model microorganisms. Alternative promising concepts are hybrid production systems of autotrophs and heterotrophs, and bio-inorganic hybrids of autotrophic microorganisms with electrocatalysts or light-harvesting semiconductor materials. In this Review, we discuss recent advances and bottlenecks for engineering microbial autotrophy and explore novel strategies that will pave the way towards improved microbial autotrophic production platforms.},

Preparing Revised Figures
To expedite publication of your paper, please follow the style guidelines given in Instructions for preparing an initial manuscript. It is best to create your figures as vector-based files such as those produced by Adobe Illustrator. Vector-based files will give us maximum flexibility for sizing your figures properly without losing resolution, as they can be altered in size while maintaining high print-quality resolution.
Submit each figure as an individual file separated from the manuscript text.
Figure layout and scaling
The width of figures, when printed, will usually be 5.5 cm (2.25 inches or 1 column) or 12.0 cm (4.75 inches or 2 columns). Bar graphs, simple line graphs, and gels may be reduced to a smaller width. Symbols and lettering should be large enough to be legible after reduction [a reduced size of about 7 points (2 mm) high, and not smaller than 5 points]. Avoid wide variation in type size within a single figure. In laying out information in a figure, the objective is to maximize the space given to presentation of the data. Avoid wasted white space and clutter.
Resolution
It is essential that revised manuscripts have adequate figure resolution for a high-quality print and online rendering of your paper. Line art that is not available as vector files should have a resolution of at least 300 dots per inch (dpi) at final print size (see “Figure layout and scaling” above), preferably higher. Grayscale and color artwork should have a minimum resolution of 300 dpi at final print size, and a higher resolution if possible.
Please note that these resolutions apply to figures sized at dimensions comparable to those of figures in the PDF or print version of the final published article. Reducing or enlarging the dimensions of a digital image will also change its effective resolution. For example, reducing the dimensions of an image by 50\%, with no change in file size, will double its effective resolution. Doubling the dimensions of the image will cut resolution by 50\%, increase visible pixilation and degrade image quality. Up-sampling artwork (artificially increasing file size or resolution) is not permitted.
Format
Figure files at the revision stage must be in one of the following formats (in preferred order):
Vector illustrations and diagrams (preferred): Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), or Adobe Illustrator (AI).

送交评审的图最好简洁少加工（比如在显微照片上加箭头）。保存未加工的文件和原始数据。丢了就什么时候搞定什么时候给你评审。最终提交的电子图像必须是高质量的，分辨率的话，彩图至少300dpi，黑白灰图600dpi，线描？（line art）要1200dpi。
一定程度的图片加工是允许的，有些领域、技术、实验是需要的，但最后图片必须能正确反映原始数据，且与行业标准相符。下面是关于图片加工程度的标准。

获取图片的工具和图片加工软件要列出，关键的图片设置参数和图片加工操作要在Method中标明。
不同时间地点获取的图片不能合关成一张图，除非那是平均时间的数据或随时间进展的结果（？）If juxtaposing images is essential, the borders should be clearly demarcated in the figure and described in the legend.
PS中的复制、修复等工具，或其他模糊修改痕迹的操作不要用。
加工（如改变明度或对比度等），除非是用于整张图和对照图。不要通过改变对比度让某些数据失真。过度加工 Excessive manipulations, such as processing to emphasize one region in the image at the expense of others (for example, through the use of a biased choice of threshold settings), is inappropriate, as is emphasizing experimental data relative to the control是不允许的。

收稿时提交最终修改图，但还会要收原始图。
Electrophoretic gels and blots
Positive and negative controls, as well as molecular size markers, should be included on each gel and blot—either in the main figure or an expanded data supplementary figure. For previously characterized antibodies, a citation must be provided. For antibodies less well characterized in the system under study, a detailed characterization that demonstrates not only the specificity of the antibody, but also the range of reactivity of the reagent in the assay, should be published as Supplementary Information or in an antibody profile database (e.g. Antibodypedia, 1DegreeBio).
The display of cropped gels and blots in the main paper is encouraged if it improves the clarity and conciseness of the presentation. In such cases, the cropping must be mentioned in the figure legend. (Some journals require full-length gels and blots in supplementary information wherever possible.)

Quantitative comparisons between samples on different gels/blots are discouraged; if this is unavoidable, the figure legend must state that the samples derive from the same experiment and that gels/blots were processed in parallel. Vertically sliced images that juxtapose lanes that were non-adjacent in the gel must have a clear separation or a black line delineating the boundary between the gels. Loading controls (e.g. GAPDH, actin) must be run on the same blot. Sample processing controls run on different gels must be identified as such, and distinctly from loading controls
Cropped gels in the paper must retain important bands.
Cropped blots in the body of the paper should retain at least six band widths above and below the band.
High-contrast gels and blots are discouraged, as overexposure may mask additional bands. Authors should strive for exposures with gray backgrounds. Multiple exposures should be presented in supplementary information if high contrast is unavoidable.
For quantitative comparisons, appropriate reagents, controls and imaging methods with linear signal ranges should be used.

Microscopy
Authors should be prepared to supply the editors with original data on request, at the resolution collected, from which their images were generated. Cells from multiple fields should not be juxtaposed in a single field; instead multiple supporting fields of cells should be shown as Supplementary Information.
Specific guidelines: Adjustments should be applied to the entire image. Threshold manipulation, expansion or contraction of signal ranges and the altering of high signals should be avoided. If "Pseudo-colouring" and nonlinear adjustment (for example "gamma changes") are used, this must be disclosed. Adjustments of individual colour channels are sometimes necessary on "merged" images, but this should be noted in the figure legend.
We encourage inclusion of the following with the final revised version of the manuscript for publication:

In the Methods, specify the type of equipment (microscopes/objective lenses, cameras, detectors, filter model and batch number) and acquisition software used. Although we appreciate that there is some variation between instruments, equipment settings for critical measurements should also be listed.
A single Supplementary Methods file (or part of a larger Methods section) titled "equipment and settings" should list for each image: acquisition information, including time and space resolution data (xyzt and pixel dimensions); image bit depth; experimental conditions such as temperature and imaging medium; and fluorochromes (excitation and emission wavelengths or ranges, filters, dichroic beamsplitters, if any).
The display lookup table (LUT) and the quantitative map between the LUT and the bitmap should be provided, especially when rainbow pseudocolor is used. If the LUT is linear and covers the full range of the data, that should be stated.
Processing software should be named and manipulations indicated (such as type of deconvolution, three-dimensional reconstructions, surface and volume rendering, "gamma changes," filtering, thresholding and projection).
Authors should state the measured resolution at which an image was acquired and any downstream processing or averaging that enhances the resolution of the image.

Editorials providing more detail for these policies:
All scientists should find the time to understand the software packages that they use to collect, analyse and display their data, and share this knowledge with new researchers. Nature Nanotechnology. Image rights and wrongs, September 2007.
In response to recent cases of image manipulation, the Nature family of journals is now "spot-checking" images from randomly chosen papers. Nature Immunology. Spot checks, March 2007.

Incorporation of the ethylenic linkage of the stilbene into a heterocyclic ring enhances the quantum efficiency and photochemical stability of the fluorophore. Compared to their widely used predecessor, "quin2", the new dyes offer up to 30-fold brighter fluorescence, major changes in wavelength not just intensity upon Ca2+ binding, slightly lower affinities for Ca2+, slightly longer wavelengths of excitation, and considerably improved selectivity for Ca2+ over other divalent cations. These properties, particularly the wavelength sensitivity to Ca2+, should make these dyes the preferred fluorescent indicators for many intracellular applications, especially in single cells, adherent cell layers, or bulk tissues.},

Here, we demonstrate that MSTN, but not GDF11, declines in healthy men throughout aging. Neither GDF11 nor MSTN levels differ as a function of age in healthy women. In an independent cohort of older adults with severe aortic stenosis, we show that individuals with higher GDF11 were more likely to be frail and have diabetes or prior cardiac conditions. Following valve replacement surgery, higher GDF11 at surgical baseline was associated with rehospitalization and multiple adverse events. Cumulatively, our results show that GDF11 levels do not decline throughout aging but are associated with comorbidity, frailty, and greater operative risk in older adults with cardiovascular disease.},

Senescent cells undergo dramatic alterations to their chromatin landscape that affect genome accessibility and their transcriptional program. These include the loss of DNA–nuclear lamina interactions, the distension of centromeres, and changes in chromatin composition that can lead to the activation of retrotransposons. Here we discuss these findings, as well as recent advances in microscopy and genomics that have revealed the importance of the higher-order spatial organization of the genome in defining and maintaining the senescent state., Novel methods to investigate genome organization [high-throughput whole-genome conformation-capture (Hi-C)] have revealed that senescent chromosomes undergo a global spatial reorganization that can alter transcription and can explain some of the observed chromatin changes [e.g. senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHFs)]., Loss of interaction between the lamina and constitutive heterochromatin induces large-scale changes in chromosome organization in cellular senescence., Centromere decondensation is an early event shared by many types of senescence and is potentially a new marker for the identification of senescent cells., SIRT6 is an early responder to DNA damage and is involved in satellite distension and derepression of retrotransposons., Change in the accessibility of heterochromatic regions leads to the mobilization of retrotransposons, which might contribute to the propagation of genomic instability.},

Here, we use a custom culture apparatus to continuously monitor five aspects of aging physiology across hundreds of isolated Caenorhabditis elegans individuals kept in a constant environment from hatching until death. Aggregating these measurements into an overall estimate of senescence, we find two chief differences between longer- and shorter-lived individuals. First, though long- and short-lived individuals are physiologically equivalent in early adulthood, longer-lived individuals experience a lower rate of physiological decline throughout life. Second, and counter-intuitively, long-lived individuals have a disproportionately extended “twilight” period of low physiological function. While longer-lived individuals experience more overall days of good health, their proportion of good to bad health, and thus their average quality of life, is systematically lower than that of shorter-lived individuals. We conclude that, within a homogeneous population reared under constant conditions, the period of early-life good health is comparatively uniform, and the most plastic period in the aging process is end-of-life senescence.},

Cacna2d2 gene deletion or silencing promoted axon growth in vitro. In vivo, Alpha2delta2 pharmacological blockade through Pregabalin (PGB) administration enhanced axon regeneration in adult mice after spinal cord injury (SCI).

We show that the differentiation of metabolite profiles of individual 1 mg parasitoid wasps of different ages is possible when using a modified sample preparation and a combination of untargeted NMR and LC-MS based metabolomics. Changes were observed between newly emerged and older wasps in glycerolipids, amino acids and circulatory sugars. This advance in chemical profiling has important implications for the study of the behaviour and ecology of parasitoids and many other species of small organisms because predictions and observations are typically made at the level of the individual. Thus, the metabolomic state of low-biomass individuals can now be related to their behaviour and ecological performance.

	abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged in recent years as major players in a multitude of pathways across species, but it remains challenging to understand which of them are important and how their functions are performed. Comparative sequence analysis has been instrumental for studying proteins and small RNAs, but the rapid evolution of lncRNAs poses new challenges that demand new approaches. Here, I review the lessons learned so far from genome-wide mapping and comparisons of lncRNAs across different species. I also discuss how comparative analyses can help us to understand lncRNA function and provide practical considerations for examining functional conservation of lncRNA genes.

	abstract = {Driven by technological progress, human life expectancy has increased greatly since the nineteenth century. Demographic evidence has revealed an ongoing reduction in old-age mortality and a rise of the maximum age at death, which may gradually extend human longevity. Together with observations that lifespan in various animal species is flexible and can be increased by genetic or pharmaceutical intervention, these results have led to suggestions that longevity may not be subject to strict, species-specific genetic constraints. Here, by analysing global demographic data, we show that improvements in survival with age tend to decline after age 100, and that the age at death of the world's oldest person has not increased since the 1990s. Our results strongly suggest that the maximum lifespan of humans is fixed and subject to natural constraints.},

	abstract = {For several decades, the role of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) has been debated. Early observational data on HRT showed many benefits, including a reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality. More recently, randomized trials, including the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), studying mostly women many years after the the onset of menopause, showed no such benefit and, indeed, an increased risk of CHD and breast cancer, which led to an abrupt decrease in the use of HRT. Subsequent reanalyzes of data from the WHI with age stratification, newer randomized and observational data and several meta-analyses now consistently show reductions in CHD and mortality when HRT is initiated soon after menopause. HRT also significantly decreases the incidence of various symptoms of menopause and the risk of osteoporotic fractures, and improves quality of life. In younger healthy women (aged 50–60 years), the risk–benefit balance is positive for using HRT, with risks considered rare. As no validated primary prevention strategies are available for younger women ({\textless}60 years of age), other than lifestyle management, some consideration might be given to HRT as a prevention strategy as treatment can reduce CHD and all-cause mortality. Although HRT should be primarily oestrogen-based, no particular HRT regimen can be advocated.},

	abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a devastating disease-causing vision loss in millions of people around the world. In advanced stages of disease, death of photoreceptor cells, retinal pigment epithelial cells, and choroidal endothelial cells (CECs) are common. Loss of endothelial cells of the choriocapillaris is one of the earliest detectable events in AMD, and, because the outer retina relies on the choriocapillaris for metabolic support, this loss may be the trigger for progression to more advanced stages. Here we highlight evidence for loss of CECs, including changes to vascular density within the choriocapillaris, altered abundance of CEC markers, and changes to overall thickness of the choroid. Furthermore, we review the key components and functions of the choroid, as well as Bruch’s membrane, both of which are vital for healthy vision. We discuss changes to the structure and molecular composition of these tissues, many of which develop with age and may contribute to AMD pathogenesis. For example, a crucial event that occurs in the aging choriocapillaris is accumulation of the membrane attack complex, which may result in complement-mediated CEC lysis, and may be a primary cause for AMD-associated choriocapillaris degeneration. The actions of elevated monomeric C-reactive protein in the choriocapillaris in at-risk individuals may also contribute to the inflammatory environment in the choroid and promote disease progression. Finally, we discuss the progress that has been made in the development of AMD therapies, with a focus on cell replacement.},

	abstract = {Dysregulation of microRNAs has been implicated in many cardiovascular diseases including fibrosis. Here we report that miR-433 was consistently elevated in three models of heart disease with prominent cardiac fibrosis, and was enriched in fibroblasts compared to cardiomyocytes. Forced expression of miR-433 in neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts increased proliferation and their differentiation into myofibroblasts as determined by EdU incorporation, α-SMA staining, and expression levels of fibrosis-associated genes. Conversely, inhibition of miR-433 exhibited opposite results. AZIN1 and JNK1 were identified as two target genes of miR-433. Decreased level of AZIN1 activated TGF-β1 while down-regulation of JNK1 resulted in activation of ERK and p38 kinase leading to Smad3 activation and ultimately cardiac fibrosis. Importantly, systemic neutralization of miR-433 or adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated cardiac transfer of a miR-433 sponge attenuated cardiac fibrosis and ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction. Thus, our work suggests that miR-433 is a potential target for amelioration of cardiac fibrosis.},

Here, we investigated the ocular surface and lacrimal gland (LG) phenotype of NOD.B10.H2b mice at 7–14, 45–50, and 96–100 weeks. Aged mice develop increased corneal permeability, CD4+ T-cell infiltration, and conjunctival goblet cell loss. Aged mice have LG atrophy with increased lymphocyte infiltration and inflammatory cytokine levels. An increase in the frequency of CD4+Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) was observed with age in the cervical lymph node (CLN), spleen, and LG. These CD4+CD25+ cells lose suppressive ability, while maintaining expression of Foxp3 (forkhead box P3) and producing interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). An increase of Foxp3+IL-17+ or Foxp3+IFN-γ+ cells was observed in the LG and LG-draining CLN. In adoptive transfer experiments, recipients of either purified Tregs or purified T effector cells from aged donors developed lacrimal keratoconjunctivitis, whereas recipients of young Tregs or young T effector cells failed to develop disease. Overall, these results suggest inflammatory cytokine-producing CD4+Foxp3+ cells participate in the pathogenesis of age-related ocular surface disease.},

The short lifespan and ample genetic resources of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) have made this species a favorite model organism for aging research, and the development of proteinopathy models in this organism has helped us to understand how aging processes affect protein aggregation and neurodegeneration.

	abstract = {This list of Nobel laureates by university affiliation shows the university affiliations (either as a student, alumnus/alumna, researcher, or faculty) of winners of the Nobel Prize and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Universities are listed in descending order according to the number of affiliates.
Each institution practices different methods for counting affiliates, from generous counting to conservative. The Unofficial Count in this list is simply the number of unique names listed here for each university. Many universities maintain their own tallies using widely divergent methodologies, most narrower than what appears on this list. Within this list, the Official Counts are those published by the universities themselves. According to these official counts, University of Cambridge has the highest number of Nobel Laureates (graduates as well as total official affiliations). Using a methodology consistent with that of University of Cambridge, Harvard University would have significantly more affiliated laureates.
For the sake of consistency, this list uses the broadest definition for university affiliation and includes people who were associated with a university for less than one year. It is not always straightforward to determine which institution was key to the contribution for which each Nobel laureate was honored. Many laureates earn their bachelor's or master's degrees at one university, then move to a different university to earn their doctorates. Some laureates may have taught or done research at more than one university. Therefore, many names will appear below as Graduates, Researchers, or Academic Staff of more than one university.
A list of laureates' university affiliations is also maintained by the Nobel Foundation, which defines the awards by the affiliation at the time of the award.
The federal University of London is counted by its individual constituent colleges in this table. The University of London and Imperial College London (which separated in 2007) together have a total of more than 80 affiliated Nobel laureates overall (including 7 Nobel laureates affiliated to the University of London International Programmes). The University of California is also counted here by its individual campuses. The University of California system as a whole is affiliated with at least 120 Nobel laureates.
This list, together with List of Fields Medal winners by university affiliation and List of Turing Award laureates by university affiliation, presents the university affiliation (with similar criteria) of people who have won highest honors in fundamental academic disciplines.

	abstract = {The University of Chicago (U of C, Chicago, or UChicago) is a private research university in Chicago, Illinois and one of the world's leading and influential institutions of higher learning, with top ten positions in numerous rankings and measures.
The university, established in 1890, is composed of the College, various graduate programs, and interdisciplinary committees organized into five academic research divisions, six professional schools, and the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies. Beyond the arts and sciences, Chicago is also well known for its professional schools, which include the Pritzker School of Medicine, the Booth School of Business, the Law School, the School of Social Service Administration, the Harris School of Public Policy Studies, and the Divinity School. The university currently enrolls approximately 5,700 students in the College and around 15,000 students overall.
University of Chicago scholars have played a major role in the development of various academic disciplines, including: the Chicago school of economics, the Chicago school of sociology, law and economics theory in legal analysis, the Chicago school of literary criticism, the Chicago school of religion, and the behavioralism school of political science. Chicago's physics department helped develop the world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction beneath the viewing stands of university's Stagg Field. Chicago's research pursuits are aided through its operation of world-renowned institutions, including the nearby Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) and Argonne National Laboratory, as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory. The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press, the largest university press in the United States. With an estimated completion date of 2020, the Barack Obama Presidential Center will be housed at the university and include both the Obama presidential library and offices of the Obama Foundation.
Founded by the American Baptist Education Society with a donation from oil magnate and wealthiest man in history John D. Rockefeller, the University of Chicago was incorporated in 1890; William Rainey Harper became the university's first president in 1891, and the first classes were held in 1892. Both Harper and future president Robert Maynard Hutchins advocated for Chicago's curriculum to be based upon theoretical and perennial issues rather than on applied sciences and commercial utility. With Harper's vision in mind, the University of Chicago also became one of the 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities, an international organization of leading research universities, in 1900.
The University of Chicago has many prominent alumni. 89 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with the university as professors, students, faculty, or staff, the fourth most of any institution in the world. Similarly, 34 faculty members and 16 alumni have been awarded the MacArthur “Genius Grant”. In addition, Chicago's alumni include 50 Rhodes Scholars, 22 Marshall Scholars, 9 Fields Medalists, 20 National Humanities Medalists, 13 billionaire graduates, and a plethora of members of the United States Congress and heads of state of countries all over the world.},

Founded in 1821 as an attempt to relocate Williams College by its president, Zephaniah Swift Moore, Amherst is the third oldest institution of higher education in Massachusetts. The institution was named after the town, which in turn had been named after Lord Jeffery Amherst. Amherst was established as a men's college and became coeducational in 1975.
Amherst is an exclusively undergraduate four-year institution and enrolled 1,795 students in the fall of 2015. Students choose courses from 38 major programs in an open curriculum. Students are not required to study a core curriculum or fulfill any distribution requirements and may even design their own unique interdisciplinary major. Freshmen may take advanced courses, and seniors may take introductory ones. For the class of 2020, Amherst received 8,397 applications and accepted 1,149 yielding a 13.7\% acceptance rate. Amherst was ranked as the second best liberal arts college in the country by U.S. News \& World Report, and 12th out of all U.S. colleges and universities by Forbes in their 2016 rankings. Amherst competes in the New England Small College Athletic Conference.
Amherst has historically had close relationships and rivalries with Williams College and Wesleyan University which form the Little Three colleges. The college is a member of the Five College Consortium, which allows its students to attend classes at four other Pioneer Valley institutions. These include Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.},

It was established in 1754 as King's College by royal charter of George II of Great Britain. Columbia is the oldest college in the state of New York and the fifth chartered institution of higher learning in the country, making it one of nine colonial colleges founded before the Declaration of Independence. After the American Revolutionary War, King's College briefly became a state entity, and was renamed Columbia College in 1784. A 1787 charter placed the institution under a private board of trustees before it was renamed Columbia University in 1896 when the campus was moved from Madison Avenue to its current location in Morningside Heights occupying 32 acres (13 ha) of land. Columbia is one of the fourteen founding members of the Association of American Universities, and was the first school in the United States to grant the M.D. degree.
The university is organized into twenty schools, including Columbia College, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the School of General Studies. The university also has global research outposts in Amman, Beijing, Istanbul, Paris, Mumbai, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, Asunción and Nairobi. It has affiliations with several other institutions nearby, including Teachers College, Barnard College, and Union Theological Seminary, with joint undergraduate programs available through the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, University College London, Sciences Po, City University of Hong Kong, and the Juilliard School.
Columbia administers annually the Pulitzer Prize. Notable alumni and former students (counting those from King's College) include five Founding Fathers of the United States; nine Justices of the United States Supreme Court; 20 living billionaires; 29 Academy Award winners; and 29 heads of state, including three United States Presidents. Additionally, 104 Nobel laureates have been affiliated with Columbia as students, researchers, faculty, or staff. Columbia is also second only to Harvard University in the number of Pulitzer Prize winning alumni and former students, with over 100 recipients as of 2015.},

	abstract = {The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current 168-acre (68.0 ha) campus opened in 1916 and extends over 1 mile (1.6 km) along the northern bank of the Charles River basin.
The Institute is traditionally known for its research and education in the physical sciences and engineering, and more recently in biology, economics, linguistics, and management as well. It is often cited as among the world's top universities. The "Engineers" sponsor 31 sports, most teams of which compete in the NCAA Division III's New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference; the Division I rowing programs compete as part of the EARC and EAWRC.
As of 2015, 85 Nobel laureates, 52 National Medal of Science recipients, 65 Marshall Scholars, 45 Rhodes Scholars, 38 MacArthur Fellows, 34 astronauts, 19 Turing award winners, 16 Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force and 6 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT. The school has a strong entrepreneurial culture, and the aggregated revenues of companies founded by MIT alumni would rank as the eleventh-largest economy in the world.},

Polytechnique was established in 1794 by the mathematician Gaspard Monge during the French Revolution, and became a military academy under Napoleon I in 1804. Today, the institution still runs under the supervision of the French ministry of Defence. Initially located in the Latin Quarter of central Paris, the establishment main buildings was moved in 1976 to Palaiseau on the Saclay Plateau, southwest of Paris.
A small and very elitist university (as current in the French Grandes Ecoles system), Polytechnique has engaged in partnerships to improve its international renown. It is thus a founding member of ParisTech, a grouping of leading Paris-area engineering colleges established in 2007. In 2014 it became a founding member of the confederal "University of Paris in Saclay". Among its alumni are three Nobel prize winners, one Fields Medalist, three Presidents of France and many CEOs of French and international companies. It is currently ranked as world's third-best small university by Times Higher Education's World University Rankings.
In the 19th century, its specific model has inspired the foundation of many similar schools throughout the world, also named "Polytechnic" such as Caltech or the École Polytechnique de Montréal.},

Founded in 1209, Cambridge is the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's fourth-oldest surviving university. The university grew out of an association of scholars who left the University of Oxford after a dispute with the townspeople. The two ancient universities share many common features and are often referred to jointly as "Oxbridge".
Cambridge is formed from a variety of institutions which include 31 constituent colleges and over 100 academic departments organised into six schools. Cambridge University Press, a department of the university, is the world's oldest publishing house and the second-largest university press in the world. The university also operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum, and a botanic garden. Cambridge's libraries hold a total of around 15 million books, eight million of which are in Cambridge University Library, a legal deposit library.
In the year ended 31 July 2015, the university had a total income of £1.64 billion, of which £398 million was from research grants and contracts. The central university and colleges have a combined endowment of around £5.89 billion, the largest of any university outside the United States. The university is closely linked with the development of the high-tech business cluster known as "Silicon Fen". It is a member of numerous associations and forms part of the "golden triangle" of leading English universities and Cambridge University Health Partners, an academic health science centre.
Cambridge is consistently ranked as one of the world's best universities. The university has educated many notable alumni, including eminent mathematicians, scientists, politicians, lawyers, philosophers, writers, actors, and foreign Heads of State. Ninety-five Nobel laureates, two Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force and ten Fields medalists have been affiliated with Cambridge as students, faculty, staff or alumni.},

Founded in 1864, Swarthmore was one of the earliest coeducational colleges in the United States. The school was organized by a committee of Quakers from three "Hicksite" yearly meetings: Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York. Many of the founders were prominent in the abolitionist and women's rights movements and other social concerns and included Edward Parrish, (1822–1872), Deborah and Joseph Wharton, Benjamin Hallowell, and James and Lucretia Mott, (1793–1880). Swarthmore was established to be a college, "...under the care of Friends, at which an education may be obtained equal to that of the best institutions of learning in our country." By 1906, Swarthmore dropped its religious affiliation, becoming officially non-sectarian.
Swarthmore is a member of the "Tri-College Consortium", a cooperative arrangement among Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr, and Haverford Colleges. In addition, the College is affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania through the "Quaker Consortium," allowing for students to cross-register for classes at all four institutions.},

	abstract = {Harvard University is a private, Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, established in 1636, whose history, influence, and wealth have made it one of the world's most prestigious universities.
Established originally by the Massachusetts legislature and soon thereafter named for John Harvard (its first benefactor), Harvard is the United States' oldest institution of higher learning, and the Harvard Corporation (formally, the President and Fellows of Harvard College) is its first chartered corporation. Although never formally affiliated with any denomination, the early College primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites. Following the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war. The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College.
The University is organized into eleven separate academic units—ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study—with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area: its 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, approximately 3 miles (5 km) northwest of Boston; the business school and athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical, dental, and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area. Harvard's \$37.6 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution.
Harvard is a large, highly residential research university. The nominal cost of attendance is high, but the University's large endowment allows it to offer generous financial aid packages. It operates several arts, cultural, and scientific museums, alongside the Harvard Library, which is the world's largest academic and private library system, comprising 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes. Harvard's alumni include eight U.S. presidents, several foreign heads of state, 62 living billionaires, 335 Rhodes Scholars, and 242 Marshall Scholars. To date, some 150 Nobel laureates, 18 Fields Medalists and 13 Turing Award winners have been affiliated as students, faculty, or staff.},

	abstract = {The École normale supérieure (French pronunciation: ​[ekɔl nɔʁmal sypeʁjœʁ]; also known as Normale sup’, ENS Ulm, ENS Paris, l'École and most often just as ENS) is a French grande école (higher education establishment outside the framework of the public university system). It was initially conceived during the French Revolution and was intended to provide the Republic with a new body of professors, trained in the critical spirit and secular values of the Enlightenment. It has since developed into an elite institution which has become a platform for many of France's brightest young people to pursue high-level careers in government and academia, and as such stands as one of the symbols of Republican meritocracy, along with École nationale d'administration and École Polytechnique ("X"), offering its alumni access to high positions within the state. Founded in 1794 and reorganised by Napoleon, ENS has two main sections (literary and scientific) and a highly competitive selection process consisting of written and oral examinations. Its students excel in the fields of culture, academic research in the sciences and humanities. During their studies, ENS students hold the status of paid civil servants.
The principal goal of ENS is the training of elite professors, researchers and public administrators. Its alumni have provided France with scores of philosophers, writers, scientists, statesmen, officials and diplomats, journalists, lawyers, directors, managers and even officers in the army and churchmen. Among them are 13 Nobel Prize laureates including 8 in Physics, 11 Fields Medalists (the most of any university in the world), more than half the recipients of the CNRS's Gold Medal (France's highest scientific prize), several hundred members of the Institut de France, several Prime Ministers, and many ministers. The school has achieved particular recognition in the fields of mathematics and physics as France's foremost scientific training ground, along with great notability in the human sciences as the spiritual birthplace of authors such as Julien Gracq, Jean Giraudoux, and Charles Péguy, philosophers such as Henri Bergson, Jean-Paul Sartre, Louis Althusser, Simone Weil, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Paul Nizan, and Alain Badiou, social scientists such as Émile Durkheim, Raymond Aron, and Pierre Bourdieu, and "French theorists" such as Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.
The ENS is a grande école and, as such, is not part of the mainstream university system, although it maintains extensive connections with it. The vast majority (97\%) of the academic staff hosted at ENS belong to external academic institutions such as the CNRS, the EHESS and the University of Paris. This mechanism for constant scientific turnover allows ENS to benefit from a continuous stream of France's topmost researchers in all fields. ENS full professorships are extremely rare and hence exceptionally competitive (22 in all subjects combined, counting both active and emeritus positions). Generalistic in its recruitment and organisation, it is the only grande école in France to have departments of research in all the natural, social, and human sciences. Its status as one of the foremost centres of French research has led to its model being replicated elsewhere, in France (at the ENSes of Lyon, Cachan, and Rennes), in Italy (at the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa), in Romania, in China and in former French colonies such as Morocco, Mali, Mauritania, and Cameroon.},

	abstract = {The California Institute of Technology (abbreviated Caltech) is a private doctorate-granting university located in Pasadena, California, United States. Although founded as a preparatory and vocational school by Amos G. Throop in 1891, the college attracted influential scientists such as George Ellery Hale, Arthur Amos Noyes, and Robert Andrews Millikan in the early 20th century. The vocational and preparatory schools were disbanded and spun off in 1910, and the college assumed its present name in 1921. In 1934, Caltech was elected to the Association of American Universities, and the antecedents of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which Caltech continues to manage and operate, were established between 1936 and 1943 under Theodore von Kármán. The university is one among a small group of Institutes of Technology in the United States which tends to be primarily devoted to the instruction of technical arts and applied sciences.
Caltech has six academic divisions with strong emphasis on science and engineering, managing \$332 million in 2011 in sponsored research. Its 124-acre (50 ha) primary campus is located approximately 11 mi (18 km) northeast of downtown Los Angeles. First-year students are required to live on campus, and 95\% of undergraduates remain in the on-campus House System at Caltech. Although Caltech has a strong tradition of practical jokes and pranks, student life is governed by an honor code which allows faculty to assign take-home examinations. The Caltech Beavers compete in 13 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division III's Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.
Caltech is frequently cited as one of the world's best universities. Caltech alumni and faculty include 34 Nobel Prizes (Linus Pauling being the only individual in history to win two unshared prizes), 1 Fields Medalist, 6 Turing Award winners, 4 Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force and 71 have won the United States National Medal of Science or Technology. There are 112 faculty members who have been elected to the United States National Academies. In addition, numerous faculty members are associated with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as well as NASA. According to a 2015 Pomona College study, Caltech ranked number one in the U.S. for the percentage of its graduates who go on to earn a PhD.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To validate the clinical efficacy and practical feasibility of massively parallel maternal plasma DNA sequencing to screen for fetal trisomy 21 among high risk pregnancies clinically indicated for amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.
DESIGN: Diagnostic accuracy validated against full karyotyping, using prospectively collected or archived maternal plasma samples.
SETTING: Prenatal diagnostic units in Hong Kong, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands.
PARTICIPANTS: 753 pregnant women at high risk for fetal trisomy 21 who underwent definitive diagnosis by full karyotyping, of whom 86 had a fetus with trisomy 21. Intervention Multiplexed massively parallel sequencing of DNA molecules in maternal plasma according to two protocols with different levels of sample throughput: 2-plex and 8-plex sequencing.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of DNA molecules that originated from chromosome 21. A trisomy 21 fetus was diagnosed when the z score for the proportion of chromosome 21 DNA molecules was {\textgreater}3. Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated for trisomy 21 detection.
RESULTS: Results were available from 753 pregnancies with the 8-plex sequencing protocol and from 314 pregnancies with the 2-plex protocol. The performance of the 2-plex protocol was superior to that of the 8-plex protocol. With the 2-plex protocol, trisomy 21 fetuses were detected at 100\% sensitivity and 97.9\% specificity, which resulted in a positive predictive value of 96.6\% and negative predictive value of 100\%. The 8-plex protocol detected 79.1\% of the trisomy 21 fetuses and 98.9\% specificity, giving a positive predictive value of 91.9\% and negative predictive value of 96.9\%.
CONCLUSION: Multiplexed maternal plasma DNA sequencing analysis could be used to rule out fetal trisomy 21 among high risk pregnancies. If referrals for amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling were based on the sequencing test results, about 98\% of the invasive diagnostic procedures could be avoided.},

	abstract = {The presence of foetal DNA in the plasma of pregnant women has opened up new possibilities for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. The use of circulating foetal DNA for the non-invasive prenatal detection of foetal chromosomal aneuploidies is challenging as foetal DNA represents a minor fraction of maternal plasma DNA. In 2007, it was shown that single molecule counting methods would allow the detection of the presence of a trisomic foetus, as long as enough molecules were counted. With the advent of massively parallel sequencing, millions or billions of DNA molecules can be readily counted. Using massively parallel sequencing, foetal trisomies 21, 13 and 18 have been detected from maternal plasma. Recently, large-scale clinical studies have validated the robustness of this approach for the prenatal detection of foetal chromosomal aneuploidies. A proof-of-concept study has also shown that a genome-wide genetic and mutational map of a foetus can be constructed from the maternal plasma DNA sequencing data. These developments suggest that the analysis of foetal DNA in maternal plasma would play an increasingly important role in future obstetrics practice. It is thus a priority that the ethical, social and legal issues regarding this technology be systematically studied.},

METHODS: We applied genomewide bisulfite sequencing via 2 approaches to analyze the methylation profile of maternal plasma DNA at single-nucleotide resolution. The first approach used maternal blood samples and polymorphic differences between the mother and fetus to analyze the fetal methylome across the genome. The second approach used the methylation profile of maternal blood cells and the fractional fetal DNA concentration in maternal plasma to deduce the placental methylomic profile from maternal plasma DNA-sequencing data.
RESULTS: Because of the noninvasive nature of these approaches, we were able to serially assess the methylation profiles of fetal, placental, and maternal plasma with maternal blood samples collected in the first and third trimesters and after delivery. Gestation-related changes were observed. The fetal methylation profile deduced from maternal plasma data resembled that of the placental methylome, both on a genomewide level and per CpG site. Imprinted genes and differentially methylated regions were identified from the maternal plasma data. We demonstrated one potential clinical application of maternal plasma bisulfite sequencing with the successful detection of fetal trisomy 21.
CONCLUSIONS: We successfully analyzed fetal and placental methylomes on a genomewide scale, noninvasively and serially. This development offers a powerful method for research, biomarker discovery, and clinical testing for pregnancy-related disorders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The potential use of plasma and serum for molecular diagnosis has generated interest. Tumour DNA has been found in 'the plasma and serum of cancer patients, and molecular analysis has been done on this material. We investigated the equivalent condition in pregnancy-that is, whether fetal DNA is present in maternal plasma and serum.
METHODS: We used a rapid-boiling method to extract DNA from plasma and serum. DNA from plasma, serum, and nucleated blood cells from 43 pregnant women underwent a sensitive Y-PCR assay to detect circulating male fetal DNA from women bearing male fetuses.
FINDINGS: Fetus-derived Y sequences were detected in 24 (80\%) of the 30 maternal plasma samples, and in 21 (70\%) of the 30 maternal serum samples, from women bearing male fetuses. These results were obtained with only 10 microL of the samples. When DNA from nucleated blood cells extracted from a similar volume of blood was used, only five (17\%) of the 30 samples gave a positive Y signal. None of the 13 women bearing female fetuses, and none of the ten non-pregnant control women, had positive results for plasma, serum or nucleated blood cells.
INTERPRETATION: Our finding of circulating fetal DNA in maternal plasma may have implications for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis, and for improving our understanding of the fetomaternal relationship.},

	abstract = {The collection of fetal genetic materials is required for the prenatal diagnosis of fetal genetic diseases. The conventional methods for sampling fetal genetic materials, such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, are invasive in nature and are associated with a risk of fetal miscarriage. For decades, scientists had been pursuing studies with goals to develop non-invasive methods for prenatal diagnosis. In 1997, the existence of fetal derived cell-free DNA molecules in plasma of pregnant women was first demonstrated. This finding provided a new source of fetal genetic material that could be obtained safely through the collection of a maternal blood sample and provided a new avenue for the development of non-invasive prenatal diagnostic tests. Now 15 years later, the diagnostic potential of circulating fetal DNA analysis has been realized. Fruitful research efforts have resulted in the clinical implementation of a number of non-invasive prenatal tests based on maternal plasma DNA analysis and included tests for fetal sex assessment, fetal rhesus D blood group genotyping and fetal chromosomal aneuploidy detection. Most recently, research groups have succeeded in decoding the entire fetal genome from maternal plasma DNA analysis which paved the way for the achievement of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of many single gene diseases. A paradigm shift in the practice of prenatal diagnosis has begun.},

Using genome-wide bisulfite sequencing of plasma DNA and deconvolution of the sequencing data with reference to methylation profiles of different tissues, we developed a general approach for studying the major tissue contributors to the circulating DNA pool. We tested this method in pregnant women, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and subjects following bone marrow and liver transplantation. In most subjects, white blood cells were the predominant contributors to the circulating DNA pool. The placental contributions in the plasma of pregnant women correlated with the proportional contributions as revealed by fetal-specific genetic markers. The graft-derived contributions to the plasma in the transplant recipients correlated with those determined using donor-specific genetic markers. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma showed elevated plasma DNA contributions from the liver, which correlated with measurements made using tumor-associated copy number aberrations. In hepatocellular carcinoma patients and in pregnant women exhibiting copy number aberrations in plasma, comparison of methylation deconvolution results using genomic regions with different copy number status pinpointed the tissue type responsible for the aberrations. In a pregnant woman diagnosed as having follicular lymphoma during pregnancy, methylation deconvolution indicated a grossly elevated contribution from B cells into the plasma DNA pool and localized B cells as the origin of the copy number aberrations observed in plasma. This method may serve as a powerful tool for assessing a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions based on the identification of perturbed proportional contributions of different tissues into plasma.},

	abstract = {Trisomy 21 is the most common reason that women opt for prenatal diagnosis. Conventional prenatal diagnostic methods involve the sampling of fetal materials by invasive procedures such as amniocentesis. Screening by ultrasonography and biochemical markers have been used to risk-stratify pregnant women before definitive invasive diagnostic procedures. However, these screening methods generally target epiphenomena, such as nuchal translucency, associated with trisomy 21. It would be ideal if noninvasive genetic methods were available for the direct detection of the core pathology of trisomy 21. Here we outline an approach using digital PCR for the noninvasive detection of fetal trisomy 21 by analysis of fetal nucleic acids in maternal plasma. First, we demonstrate the use of digital PCR to determine the allelic imbalance of a SNP on PLAC4 mRNA, a placenta-expressed transcript on chromosome 21, in the maternal plasma of women bearing trisomy 21 fetuses. We named this the digital RNA SNP strategy. Second, we developed a nonpolymorphism-based method for the noninvasive prenatal detection of trisomy 21. We named this the digital relative chromosome dosage (RCD) method. Digital RCD involves the direct assessment of whether the total copy number of chromosome 21 in a sample containing fetal DNA is overrepresented with respect to a reference chromosome. Even without elaborate instrumentation, digital RCD allows the detection of trisomy 21 in samples containing 25\% fetal DNA. We applied the sequential probability ratio test to interpret the digital PCR data. Computer simulation and empirical validation confirmed the high accuracy of the disease classification algorithm.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Glanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare disorder of platelet function that may result in life-threatening hemorrhage, particularly from the nasal vaults. Various medical therapies (such as recombinant factor VII, antifibrinolytic agents, and blood transfusions) and surgical therapies (such as nasal packing, electrocautery, laser coagulation, septoplasty, and embolization) have been described with various degrees of success.
METHODS: We present a unique case report of a 4-year-old child with known Glanzmann thrombasthenia and two separate episodes of life-threatening epistaxis that were treated successfully by nasal packing with strips of cured pork because of special circumstances.
RESULTS: Cured salted pork crafted as a nasal tampon and packed within the nasal vaults successfully stopped nasal hemorrhage promptly, effectively, and without sequelae. In both applications, the patient had complete cessation of nasal bleeding within 24 hours, and was discharged within 72 hours after treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this represents the first description of nasal packing with strips of cured pork for treatment of life-threatening hemorrhage in a patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of pain on travelling over speed bumps for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
DESIGN: Prospective questionnaire based diagnostic accuracy study.
SETTING: Secondary care surgical assessment unit at a district general hospital in the UK.
PARTICIPANTS: 101 patients aged 17-76 years referred to the on-call surgical team for assessment of possible appendicitis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for pain over speed bumps in diagnosing appendicitis, with histological diagnosis of appendicitis as the reference standard.
RESULTS: The analysis included 64 participants who had travelled over speed bumps on their journey to hospital. Of these, 34 had a confirmed histological diagnosis of appendicitis, 33 of whom reported increased pain over speed bumps. The sensitivity was 97\% (95\% confidence interval 85\% to 100\%), and the specificity was 30\% (15\% to 49\%). The positive predictive value was 61\% (47\% to 74\%), and the negative predictive value was 90\% (56\% to 100\%). The likelihood ratios were 1.4 (1.1 to 1.8) for a positive test result and 0.1 (0.0 to 0.7) for a negative result. Speed bumps had a better sensitivity and negative likelihood ratio than did other clinical features assessed, including migration of pain and rebound tenderness.
CONCLUSIONS: Presence of pain while travelling over speed bumps was associated with an increased likelihood of acute appendicitis. As a diagnostic variable, it compared favourably with other features commonly used in clinical assessment. Asking about speed bumps may contribute to clinical assessment and could be useful in telephone assessment of patients.},

	volume = {8},
	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0082756},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to test whether central mechanisms of scratching-induced itch attenuation can be activated by scratching the limb contralateral to the itching limb when the participant is made to visually perceive the non-itching limb as the itching limb by means of mirror images.
METHODS: Healthy participants were asked to assess the intensity of an experimentally induced itch at their right forearm while they observed externally guided scratch movements either at their right (itching) or left (non-itching) forearm which were either mirrored or not mirrored. In the first experiment, a mirror placed between the participant's forearms was used to create the visual illusion that the participant's itching (right) forearm was being scratched while in fact the non-itching (left) forearm was scratched. To control visibility of the left (non-mirrored) forearm, a second experiment was performed in which unflipped and flipped real-time video displays of the participant's forearms were used to create experimental conditions in which the participant visually perceived scratching either on one forearm only, on both forearms, or no scratching at all.
RESULTS: In both experiments, scratching the non-itching limb attenuated perceived itch intensity significantly and selectively in the mirror condition, i.e., when the non-itching forearm was visually perceived as the itching limb.
DISCUSSION: These data provide evidence that the visual illusion that an itching limb is being scratched while in fact the non-itching limb contralateral to the itching limb is scratched, can lead to significant itch relief. This effect might be due to a transient illusionary intersensory perceptual congruency of visual, tactile and pruriceptive signals. "Mirror scratching" might provide an alternative treatment to reduce itch perception in focal skin diseases with persistent pruritus without causing additional harm to the affected skin and might therefore have significant clinical impact.},

	doi = {10.1186/1472-6920-6-11},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The motivational and other factors used by medical students in making their career choices for specific medical specialities have been looked at in a number of studies in the literature. There are however few studies that assess the generic factors which make medicine itself of interest to medical students and to potential medical students. This study describes a novel questionnaire that assesses the interests and attractions of different aspects of medical practice in a varied range of medical scenarios, and relates them to demographic, academic, personality and learning style measures in a large group of individuals considering applying to medical school.
METHODS: A questionnaire study was conducted among those attending Medlink, a two-day conference for individuals considering applying to medical school for a career in medicine. The main outcome measure was the Medical Situations Questionnaire, in which individuals ranked the attraction of three different aspects of medical practise in each of nine detailed, realistic medical scenarios in a wide range of medical specialities. As well as requiring clear choices, the questionnaire was also designed so that all of the possible answers were attractive and positive, thereby helping to eliminate social demand characteristics. Factor analysis of the responses found four generic motivational dimensions, which we labelled Indispensability, Helping People, Respect and Science. Background factors assessed included sex, ethnicity, class, medical parents, GCSE academic achievement, the 'Big Five' personality factors, empathy, learning styles, and a social desirability scale.
RESULTS: 2867 individuals, broadly representative of applicants to medical schools, completed the questionnaire. The four generic motivational factors correlated with a range of background factors. These correlations were explored by multiple regression, and by path analysis, using LISREL to assess direct and indirect effects upon the factors. Helping People was particularly related to agreeableness; Indispensability to a strategic approach to learning; Respect to a surface approach to learning; and Science to openness to experience. Sex had many indirect influences upon generic motivations. Ethnic origin also had indirect influences via neuroticism and surface learning, and social class only had indirect influences via lower academic achievement. Coming from a medical family had no influence upon generic motivations.
CONCLUSION: Generic motivations for medicine as a career can be assessed using the Medical Situations Questionnaire, without undue response bias due to demand characteristics. The validity of the motivational factors is suggested by the meaningful and interpretable correlations with background factors such as demographics, personality, and learning styles. Further development of the questionnaire is needed if it is to be used at an individual level, either for counselling or for student selection.},

	abstract = {André-Marie Ampère (/ˈæmpɪər/; French: [ɑ̃pɛʁ]; 20 January 1775 – 10 June 1836) was a French physicist and mathematician who was one of the founders of the science of classical electromagnetism, which he referred to as "electrodynamics". The SI unit of measurement of electric current, the ampere, is named after him.
Andre-Marie Ampère was born on 20 January 1775 to Jean-Jacques Ampère, a prosperous businessman, and Jeanne Antoinette Desutières-Sarcey Ampère, during the height of the French Enlightenment. He spent his childhood and adolescence at the family property at Poleymieux-au-Mont-d'Or near Lyon. Jean-Jacques Ampère, a successful merchant, was an admirer of the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose theories of education (as outlined in his treatise Émile) were the basis of Ampère's education. Rousseau believed that young boys should avoid formal schooling and pursue instead an "education direct from nature." Ampère's father actualized this ideal by allowing his son to educate himself within the walls of his well-stocked library. French Enlightenment masterpieces such as Georges-Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon's Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière (begun in 1749) and Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert's Encyclopédie (volumes added between 1751 and 1772) thus became Ampère's schoolmasters. The young Ampère, however, soon resumed his Latin lessons, which enabled him to master the works of Leonhard Euler and Daniel Bernoulli.},

	abstract = {William James (January 11, 1842 – August 26, 1910) was an American philosopher and psychologist who was also trained as a physician. The first educator to offer a psychology course in the United States, James was one of the leading thinkers of the late nineteenth century and is believed by many to be one of the most influential philosophers the United States has ever produced, while others have labelled him the "Father of American psychology". Along with Charles Sanders Peirce and John Dewey, he is considered to be one of the major figures associated with the philosophical school known as pragmatism, and is also cited as one of the founders of functional psychology. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked James as the 14th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. He also developed the philosophical perspective known as radical empiricism. James' work has influenced intellectuals such as Émile Durkheim, W. E. B. Du Bois, Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Hilary Putnam, and Richard Rorty, and has even influenced Presidents, such as Jimmy Carter.
Born into a wealthy family, James was the son of the Swedenborgian theologian Henry James Sr and the brother of both the prominent novelist Henry James, and the diarist Alice James. James wrote widely on many topics, including epistemology, education, metaphysics, psychology, religion, and mysticism. Among his most influential books are The Principles of Psychology, which was a groundbreaking text in the field of psychology, Essays in Radical Empiricism, an important text in philosophy, and The Varieties of Religious Experience, which investigated different forms of religious experience, which also included the then theories on Mind cure.},

RESULTS: In this study, scientists (n = 24) and non-scientist controls (n = 26) were assessed with respect to their five-factor personality traits, 10 basic values, and subjective well-being (subjective happiness and sense of purpose in life). Compared with the non-scientist control group and with normative data of laypeople, the scientists consistently exhibited greater openness (i.e., traits related to curiosity and intelligence), self-direction (i.e., values related to the pursuit of curiosity, creativity, and autonomous action), happiness, and sense of purpose in life.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that scientists possess personality traits and values suitable for a career in science, from which they also derive subjective well-being.},

	abstract = {Genome sequencing enhances our understanding of the biological world by providing blueprints for the evolutionary and functional diversity that shapes the biosphere. However, microbial genomes that are currently available are of limited phylogenetic breadth, owing to our historical inability to cultivate most microorganisms in the laboratory. We apply single-cell genomics to target and sequence 201 uncultivated archaeal and bacterial cells from nine diverse habitats belonging to 29 major mostly uncharted branches of the tree of life, so-called ‘microbial dark matter’. With this additional genomic information, we are able to resolve many intra- and inter-phylum-level relationships and to propose two new superphyla. We uncover unexpected metabolic features that extend our understanding of biology and challenge established boundaries between the three domains of life. These include a novel amino acid use for the opal stop codon, an archaeal-type purine synthesis in Bacteria and complete sigma factors in Archaea similar to those in Bacteria. The single-cell genomes also served to phylogenetically anchor up to 20\% of metagenomic reads in some habitats, facilitating organism-level interpretation of ecosystem function. This study greatly expands the genomic representation of the tree of life and provides a systematic step towards a better understanding of biological evolution on our planet.

	abstract = {Nucleoli form around tandem arrays of a ribosomal gene repeat, termed nucleolar organizer regions (NORs). During metaphase, active NORs adopt a characteristic undercondensed morphology. Recent evidence indicates that the HMG-box-containing DNA-binding protein UBF (upstream binding factor) is directly responsible for this morphology and provides a mitotic bookmark to ensure rapid nucleolar formation beginning in telophase in human cells. This is likely to be a widely employed strategy, as UBF is present throughout metazoans. In higher eukaryotes, NORs are typically located within regions of chromosomes that form perinucleolar heterochromatin during interphase. Typically, the genomic architecture of NORs and the chromosomal regions within which they lie is very poorly described, yet recent evidence points to a role for context in their function. In Arabidopsis, NOR silencing appears to be controlled by sequences outside the rDNA (ribosomal DNA) array. Translocations reveal a role for context in the expression of the NOR on the X chromosome in Drosophila Recent work has begun on characterizing the genomic architecture of human NORs. A role for distal sequences located in perinucleolar heterochromatin has been inferred, as they exhibit a complex transcriptionally active chromatin structure. Links between rDNA genomic stability and aging in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are now well established, and indications are emerging that this is important in aging and replicative senescence in higher eukaryotes. This, combined with the fact that rDNA arrays are recombinational hot spots in cancer cells, has focused attention on DNA damage responses in NORs. The introduction of DNA double-strand breaks into rDNA arrays leads to a dramatic reorganization of nucleolar structure. Damaged rDNA repeats move from the nucleolar interior to form caps at the nucleolar periphery, presumably to facilitate repair, suggesting that the chromosomal context of human NORs contributes to their genomic stability. The inclusion of NORs and their surrounding chromosomal environments in future genome drafts now becomes a priority.},

Here we address whether this non-coding transcription arises at promoters, and detail the interactions of initiation factors TATA box binding protein (TBP), transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) and RNA polymerase (Pol) II. Using ChIP-exo (chromatin immunoprecipitation with lambda exonuclease digestion followed by high-throughput sequencing), we identify approximately 160,000 transcription initiation complexes across the human K562 genome, and more in other cancer genomes. Only about 5\% associate with messenger RNA genes. The remainder associates with non-polyadenylated non-coding transcription. Regardless, Pol II moves into a transcriptionally paused state, and TBP and TFIIB remain at the promoter. Remarkably, the vast majority of locations contain the four core promoter elements— upstream TFIIB recognition element (BREu), TATA, downstream TFIIB recognition element (BREd), and initiator element (INR)—in constrained positions. All but the INR also reside at Pol III promoters, where TBP makes similar contacts. This comprehensive and high-resolution genome-wide detection of the initiation machinery produces a consolidated view of transcription initiation events from yeast to humans at Pol II/III TATA-containing/TATA-less coding and non-coding genes.},

A recent study measured 159,117 DNA binding regions of transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) by ChIP-exo (chromatin immunoprecipitation with lambda exonuclease digestion followed by high-throughput sequencing) in human cells, found four degenerate CPEs—upstream and downstream TFIIB recognition elements (BREu and BREd), TATA and initiator element (INR)—in nearly all of them, and concluded that these regions represent sites of transcription initiation marked by universal CPEs. We show that the claimed universality of CPEs is explained by the low specificities of the patterns used and that the same match frequencies are obtained with two negative controls (randomized sequences and scrambled patterns). Our analyses also cast doubt on the biological significance of most of the 150,753 non-messenger-RNA-associated ChIP-exo peaks, 72\% of which lie within repetitive regions.

The peer review helps the publisher (that is, the editor-in-chief or the editorial board) decide whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected. Peer review requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) field, who are qualified and able to perform reasonably impartial review. Impartial review, especially of work in less narrowly defined or inter-disciplinary fields, may be difficult to accomplish, and the significance (good or bad) of an idea may never be widely appreciated among its contemporaries. Peer review is generally considered necessary to academic quality and is used in most major scientific journals, but does by no means prevent publication of all invalid research. Traditionally, peer reviewers have been anonymous, but there is currently a significant amount of open peer review, where the comments are visible to readers, generally with the identities of the peer reviewers disclosed as well.},

	abstract = {Scientific impact—that is the Q
Are there quantifiable patterns behind a successful scientific career? Sinatra et al. analyzed the publications of 2887 physicists, as well as data on scientists publishing in a variety of fields. When productivity (which is usually greatest early in the scientist's professional life) is accounted for, the paper with the greatest impact occurs randomly in a scientist's career. However, the process of generating a high-impact paper is not an entirely random one. The authors developed a quantitative model of impact, based on an element of randomness, productivity, and a factor Q that is particular to each scientist and remains constant during the scientist's career.
Science, this issue p. 596
Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONIn most areas of human performance, from sport to engineering, the path to a major accomplishment requires a steep learning curve and long practice. Science is not that different: Outstanding discoveries are often preceded by publications of less memorable impact. However, despite the increasing desire to identify early promising scientists, the temporal career patterns that characterize the emergence of scientific excellence remain unknown.
RATIONALEHow do impact and productivity change over a scientific career? Does impact, arguably the most relevant performance measure, follow predictable patterns? Can we predict the timing of a scientist’s outstanding achievement? Can we model, in quantitative and predictive terms, scientific careers? Driven by these questions, here we quantify the evolution of impact and productivity throughout thousands of scientific careers. We do so by reconstructing the publication record of scientists from seven disciplines, associating to each paper its long-term impact on the scientific community, as quantified by citation metrics.
RESULTSWe find that the highest-impact work in a scientist’s career is randomly distributed within her body of work. That is, the highest-impact work can be, with the same probability, anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist—it could be the first publication, could appear mid-career, or could be a scientist’s last publication. This random-impact rule holds for scientists in different disciplines, with different career lengths, working in different decades, and publishing solo or with teams and whether credit is assigned uniformly or unevenly among collaborators.The random-impact rule allows us to develop a quantitative model, which systematically untangles the role of productivity and luck in each scientific career. The model assumes that each scientist selects a project with a random potential p and improves on it with a factor Qi, resulting in a publication of impact Qip. The parameter Qi captures the ability of scientist i to take advantage of the available knowledge in a way that enhances (Qi {\textgreater} 1) or diminishes (Qi {\textless} 1) the potential impact p of a paper. The model predicts that truly high-impact discoveries require a combination of high Q and luck (p) and that increased productivity alone cannot substantially enhance the chance of a very high impact work. We also show that a scientist’s Q, capturing her sustained ability to publish high-impact papers, is independent of her career stage. This is in contrast with all current metrics of excellence, from the total number of citations to the h-index, which increase with time. The Q model provides an analytical expression of these traditional impact metrics and allows us to predict their future time evolution for each individual scientist, being also predictive of independent recognitions, like Nobel prizes.
CONCLUSIONThe random-impact rule and the Q parameter, representing two fundamental characteristics of a scientific career, offer a rigorous quantitative framework to explore the evolution of individual careers and understand the emergence of scientific excellence. Such understanding could help us better gauge scientific performance and offers a path toward nurturing high-impact scientists, potentially informing future policy decisions. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/354/6312/aaf5239/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Random-impact rule.The publication history of two Nobel laureates, Frank A.

Fenn (Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 2002), illustrating that the highest-impact work can be, with the same probability, anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist. Each vertical line corresponds to a research paper. The height of each line corresponds to paper impact, quantified with the number of citations the paper received after 10 years. Wilczek won the Nobel Prize for the very first paper he published, whereas Fenn published his Nobel-awarded work late in his career, after he was forcefully retired by Yale. [Image of Frank A.

Despite the frequent use of numerous quantitative indicators to gauge the professional impact of a scientist, little is known about how scientific impact emerges and evolves in time. Here, we quantify the changes in impact and productivity throughout a career in science, finding that impact, as measured by influential publications, is distributed randomly within a scientist’s sequence of publications. This random-impact rule allows us to formulate a stochastic model that uncouples the effects of productivity, individual ability, and luck and unveils the existence of universal patterns governing the emergence of scientific success. The model assigns a unique individual parameter Q to each scientist, which is stable during a career, and it accurately predicts the evolution of a scientist’s impact, from the h-index to cumulative citations, and independent recognitions, such as prizes.
Productivity, ability, and luck are incorporated into an algorithm describing a scientist’s impact.

	abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Previous works suggested that neutralizing intratumoral lactic acidosis combined with glucose deprivation may deliver an effective approach to control tumor. We did a pilot clinical investigation, including a nonrandomized (57 patients with large HCC) and a randomized controlled (20 patients with large HCC) studies.
METHODS: The patients were treated with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with or without bicarbonate local infusion into tumor.
RESULTS: In the nonrandomized controlled study, geometric mean of viable tumor residues (VTR) in TACE with bicarbonate was 6.4-fold lower than that in TACE without bicarbonate (7.1\% [95\% CI: 4.6\%-10.9\%] vs 45.6\% [28.9\%-72.0\%]; p{\textless}0.0001). This difference was recapitulated by a subsequent randomized controlled study. TACE combined with bicarbonate yielded a 100\% objective response rate (ORR), whereas the ORR treated with TACE alone was 44.4\% (nonrandomized) and 63.6\% (randomized). The survival data suggested that bicarbonate may bring survival benefit.
CONCLUSION: Bicarbonate markedly enhances the anticancer activity of TACE.Clinical trail registration: ChiCTR-IOR-14005319.},

During apoptosis, Bid is cleaved (cBid) and translocates to the MOM, where it activates Bax. Bax then oligomerizes and induces MOM permeabilization. However, little is known about how these proteins affect membrane organization aside from pore formation. In previous studies, we have shown that both cBid and Bax are able to remodel membranes and stabilize curvature. Here, we dissected the independent effects of Bax and cBid on supported lipid structures mimicking the mitochondrial composition by means of atomic force spectroscopy. We show that cBid did not permeabilize the membrane but lowered the membrane breakthrough force. On the other hand, Bax effects were dependent on its oligomeric state. Monomeric Bax did not affect the membrane properties. In contrast, oligomeric Bax lowered the breakthrough force of the membrane, which in the context of pore formation, implies a lowering of the line tension at the edge of the pore.},

As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines computer science, statistics, mathematics, and engineering to analyze and interpret biological data. Bioinformatics has been used for in silico analyses of biological queries using mathematical and statistical techniques.
Bioinformatics is both an umbrella term for the body of biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology, as well as a reference to specific analysis "pipelines" that are repeatedly used, particularly in the field of genomics. Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidate genes and nucleotides (SNPs). Often, such identification is made with the aim of better understanding the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural species), or differences between populations. In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organisational principles within nucleic acid and protein sequences.},

	abstract = {In genetics, a genome-wide association study (GWA study, or GWAS), also known as whole genome association study (WGA study, or WGAS), is an examination of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait. GWASs typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other organism.

In the case of GWAS applied to human data, these studies compare the DNA of participants having varying phenotypes for a particular trait or disease. Participants in a GWAS study may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without (controls), or they may be people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to be associated with the disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome that may influence the risk of disease. In contrast to methods that specifically test one or a few genetic regions, the GWA studies investigate the entire genome. The approach is therefore said to be non-candidate-driven in contrast to gene-specific candidate-driven studies. GWA studies identify SNPs and other variants in DNA associated with a disease, but they cannot on their own specify which genes are causal.
The first successful GWAS was published in 2005. It investigated patients with age-related macular degeneration and found two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency compared to healthy controls. As of 2011, hundreds or thousands of individuals are tested, over 1,200 human GWA studies have examined over 200 diseases and traits, and almost 4,000 SNP associations have been found. Several GWA studies have received criticism for omitting important quality control steps, rendering the findings invalid, but modern publications address these issues. However, the methodology itself still has opponents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This retrospective cohort study was to determine the frequency and types of chromosomal abnormalities in Han Chinese women with well-documented premature ovarian failure (POF).
METHODS: Karyotype analysis and correlation to phenotypes were performed on 531 Chinese patients with proven POF (FSH {\textgreater} 40 mIU/ml) attending four reproductive centers in China. G-banded metaphase chromosomes were prepared and analyzed, with mosaicism excluded by counting up to 100 cells from lymphocytes.
RESULTS: Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 64 of 531 (12.1\%) POF cases, of which 32 were X-structural aberrations (7 mosaic): 15 del(Xq), 2 del(Xp), 11 isochromosomes [6 i(Xp); 5 i(Xq)], 1 ring chromosome (mosaic), 1 inversion (mosaic), 1 isodicentric chromosome and 1 complex arrangement. Nine non-mosaic X-autosome translocations were detected, all but 1 involving Xq. Aneuploidy without a structurally abnormal X was found in 19 cases: 7 non-mosaic 45,X, 9 45,X mosaicisms and 3 47,XXX (1 mosaic with 46,XX line). Karyotypic abnormalities were more frequent in patients with primary amenorrhea (15/70, 21.4\%) than those with secondary amenorrhea (49/461, 10.6\%; P = 0.01). 45,X and 45,X/46,XX mosaicism were the complements most frequently associated with primary amenorrhea (46.7\%). Two of the three cases with 46,XY or 45,X/46,XY karyotype presented with 'secondary amenorrhea'. One balanced autosomal Robertsonian translocation was also detected.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of chromosomal abnormalities was 12.1\% in this first large scale report of chromosomal aberrations in Chinese women with POF. In one of the largest samples of women with POF reported from any population, the prevalence of X-structural abnormalities, X-autosome translocations and X aneuploidy confirms the essential role X chromosomal abnormalities play in POF.},

	volume = {158},
	issn = {1479-683X},
	doi = {10.1530/EJE-07-0400},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine whether mutations of meiotic genes, such as disrupted meiotic cDNA (DMC1), MutS homolog (MSH4), MSH5, and S. cerevisiae homolog (SPO11), were associated with premature ovarian failure (POF).
DESIGN: Case-control study.
METHODS: Blood sampling, karyotype, hormonal dosage, ultrasound, and ovarian biopsy were carried out on most patients. However, the main outcome measure was the sequencing of genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples of 41 women with POF and 36 fertile women (controls).
RESULTS: A single heterozygous missense mutation, substitution of a cytosine residue with thymidine in exon 2 of MSH5, was found in two Caucasian women in whom POF developed at 18 and 36 years of age. This mutation resulted in replacement of a non-polar amino acid (proline) with a polar amino acid (serine) at position 29 (P29S). Neither 36 control women nor 39 other patients with POF possessed this genetic perturbation. Another POF patient of African origin showed a homozygous nucleotide change in the tenth of DMC1 gene that led to an alteration of the amino acid composition of the protein (M200V).
CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms of infertility observed in the DMC1 homozygote mutation carrier and in both patients with a heterozygous substitution in exon 2 of the MSH5 gene provide indirect evidence of the role of genes involved in meiotic recombination in the regulation of ovarian function. MSH5 and DMC1 mutations may be one explanation for POF, albeit uncommon.},

	volume = {17},
	issn = {1090-0535},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To screen α-crystallin (CRYAB), γ-crystallin (CRYGC and CRYGD), and Connexin 50 (Cx-50 or GJA8) genes in congenital cataract patients and controls.
METHODS: Thirty clinically diagnosed congenital cataract cases below 3 years of age from northern India, presenting at Dr. R. P. Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences (AIIMS, New Delhi, India) were enrolled in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood, all coding and exon/intron regions were amplified using PCR and direct sequencing was performed to detect any nucleotide variation. ProtScale and Discovery Studio programs were used for insilico and structural analysis of non-synonymous mutations.
RESULTS: DNA sequencing analysis of CRYAB, CRYGC, CRYGD, and GJA8 showed a total of six variations of which two were novel (CRYGC:p.R48H and GJA8:p.L281C) and four have been previously reported (CRYAB: rs11603779T{\textgreater}G, GJA8: p.L268L, CRYGD: p.R95R, and c.T564C). Both the novel changes, in CRYGC and GJA8 were found in 16.6\% of the patients. Previously reported nucleotide alterations (CRYGD:p.R95R and c.T564C) were found in 90\% of the patients. Insilico and structural analysis data suggested that two novel non-synonymous mutations altered the stability and solvent accessibility of γC-crystallin and Cx-50 proteins which may lead to lens opacification.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed two novel nonsynonymous variations and four reported variations in CRYAB, CRYGC, CRYGD, and GJA8. The p.R48H variation in γC-crystallin may disrupt the normal structure of lens and can cause cataract. Cx50 is responsible for joining the lens cells into a functional syncytium and a mutation (p.L281C) in GJA8 may lead to lens opacification resulting in cataract formation. This study further expands the mutation spectrum of congenital cataract and help understanding how mutant proteins lead to opacification of lens.},

This catalogue of human genetic diversity contains an average of one variant every eight bases of the exome, and provides direct evidence for the presence of widespread mutational recurrence. We have used this catalogue to calculate objective metrics of pathogenicity for sequence variants, and to identify genes subject to strong selection against various classes of mutation; identifying 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion of predicted protein-truncating variants, with 72\% of these genes having no currently established human disease phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that these data can be used for the efficient filtering of candidate disease-causing variants, and for the discovery of human ‘knockout’ variants in protein-coding genes.},

	abstract = {The Hippo pathway regulates tissue growth and organ size, and inactivation contributes to cancer. Signals flow through Mst/Lats kinases, which phosphorylate and promote cytoplasmic localization of the transcriptional regulators Yap and Taz to inhibit transcription. Here, we identify the multidomain‐containing guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Arhgef7, or βPix, as a positive Hippo pathway regulator. We show that βPix, which localizes to the cytoplasm, binds both Lats and Yap/Taz and thereby promotes Lats‐mediated phosphorylation of Yap/Taz in a GEF‐independent manner. βPix is required downstream of both cell density sensing and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, and we demonstrate that loss of βPix expression in normal mammary epithelial cells strongly reduces Yap/Taz phosphorylation, promotes nuclear localization and increases target gene expression. Conversely, increased expression of βPIX in breast cancer cell lines re‐couples the Hippo kinase cassette to Yap/Taz, promoting localization of Yap/Taz to the cytoplasm and inhibiting cell migration and proliferation. These studies thus define βPix as a key component that links the Hippo kinase cassette to Yap/Taz in response to multiple upstream Hippo pathway activators.

βPix (Arhgef7) is required for cytoplasmic accumulation of Yap/Taz induced by either high cell density or cytoskeletal remodelling and acts by scaffolding the hippo kinase component Lats to Yap/Taz.

Hippo pathway activation induces phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization of the transcriptional regulators Yap/Taz.βPix promotes Yap/Taz cytoplasmic localization and phosphorylation.βPix scaffolds Lats to Yap/Taz to facilitate Yap/Taz phosphorylation.βPix overexpression attenuates proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells.},

	abstract = {A variety of environmental factors have been shown to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and phenotypic variation. This involves the germline transmission of epigenetic information between generations. Exposure specific transgenerational sperm epimutations have been previously observed. The current study was designed to investigate the potential role genetic mutations have in the process, using copy number variations (CNV). In the first (F1) generation following exposure, negligible CNV were identified; however, in the transgenerational F3 generation, a significant increase in CNV was observed in the sperm. The genome-wide locations of differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations) and genetic mutations (CNV) were investigated. Observations suggest the environmental induction of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of sperm epimutations promote genome instability, such that genetic CNV mutations are acquired in later generations. A combination of epigenetics and genetics is suggested to be involved in the transgenerational phenotypes. The ability of environmental factors to promote epigenetic inheritance that subsequently promotes genetic mutations is a significant advance in our understanding of how the environment impacts disease and evolution.},

This phenomenon is termed epigenetic transgenerational inheritance and has been shown to in part involve alterations in DNA methylation, but the role of other epigenetic mechanisms remains unknown. The current study investigated the alterations in small noncoding RNA (sncRNA) in the sperm from F3 generation control and vinclozolin lineage rats. Over 200 differentially expressed sncRNAs were identified and the tRNA-derived sncRNAs, namely 5′ halves of mature tRNAs (5′ halves), displayed the most dramatic changes. Gene targets of the altered miRNAs and tRNA 5′ halves revealed associations between the altered sncRNAs and differentially DNA methylated regions. Dysregulated sncRNAs appear to correlate with mRNA profiles associated with the previously observed vinclozolin-induced disease phenotypes. Data suggest potential connections between sperm-borne RNAs and the vinclozolin-induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon.},

Transient exposure of a gestating female rat during the period of gonadal sex determination to the endocrine disruptors vinclozolin (an antiandrogenic compound) or methoxychlor (an estrogenic compound) induced an adult phenotype in the F1 generation of decreased spermatogenic capacity (cell number and viability) and increased incidence of male infertility. These effects were transferred through the male germ line to nearly all males of all subsequent generations examined (that is, F1 to F4). The effects on reproduction correlate with altered DNA methylation patterns in the germ line.

Here we present more than 153 million base pairs representing 99.4\% of the euchromatic sequence of chromosome 7, the first metacentric chromosome completed so far. The sequence has excellent concordance with previously established physical and genetic maps, and it exhibits an unusual amount of segmentally duplicated sequence (8.2\%), with marked differences between the two arms. Our initial analyses have identified 1,150 protein-coding genes, 605 of which have been confirmed by complementary DNA sequences, and an additional 941 pseudogenes. Of genes confirmed by transcript sequences, some are polymorphic for mutations that disrupt the reading frame.},

	abstract = {The sequence of the human genome encodes the genetic instructions for human physiology, as well as rich information about human evolution. In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome. Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers approximately 99\% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of approximately 1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death. Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000-25,000 protein-coding genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead.},

Visualizing genomic coordinates of SNPs, including their physical location relative to their host gene, and the structure of the relevant transcripts, may provide intuitive supplements to the understanding of their functions. Nevertheless, to date, no such easy-to-use programming tools exist. Therefore, we developed an R package, “mapsnp”, to plot genomic map for a panel of SNPs within a genome region of interest, including the relative chromosome location and the transcripts in the region. mapsnp is a simple and flexible software package which can be used to visualize a genomic map for SNPs, integrating a chromosome ideogram, genomic coordinates, SNP locations and SNP labels.},

We start by reviewing the debate about the adaptive versus maladaptive qualities of emotion. We then explore the literature on intelligence, and especially social intelligence, to examine the place of emotion in traditional intelligence conceptions. A framework for integrating the research on emotion-related skills is then described. Next, we review the components of emotional intelligence. To conclude the review, the role of emotional intelligence in mental health is discussed and avenues for further investigation are suggested.},

	abstract = {Trachoma is one of the most widespread blinding eye diseases, which is harmful to human visual health. The efforts to prevent and control trachoma in China can be divided into three periods, i.e., highly epidemic period, research on pathogenesis and control of trachoma, and blinding trachoma elimination and epidemiological evaluation. In 1956, Prof. Feifan Tang and Xiaolou Zhang first discovered and isolated Chlamydia trachomatis, which clarified the cause of trachoma, and kick-started a fresh chapter in trachoma research, prevention, and control around the world. Although, the prevalence of trachoma differed in different areas, the average prevalence once exceeded 50\% and was as high as 90\% in some areas before and at early liberation of China. Therefore, the government-led efforts were made to comprehensively prevent and control trachoma, including development of National Plan for the Prevention and Control of Trachoma, nationwide screening and treatment of trachoma, implementation of National Patriotic Health Campaign and improvement of water supply and lavatories. After decades of effort, China reached the goal of eliminating blinding trachoma in 2015. China has gained remarkable achievements in the prevention and treatment of trachoma, making outstanding contributions toward the goal of eliminating trachoma worldwide. The research, prevention, and control of trachoma in China were reviewed in this paper.},

	abstract = {Cancer is associated with mutated genes, and analysis of tumour-linked genetic alterations is increasingly used for diagnostic, prognostic and treatment purposes. The genetic profile of solid tumours is currently obtained from surgical or biopsy specimens; however, the latter procedure cannot always be performed routinely owing to its invasive nature. Information acquired from a single biopsy provides a spatially and temporally limited snap-shot of a tumour and might fail to reflect its heterogeneity. Tumour cells release circulating free DNA (cfDNA) into the blood, but the majority of circulating DNA is often not of cancerous origin, and detection of cancer-associated alleles in the blood has long been impossible to achieve. Technological advances have overcome these restrictions, making it possible to identify both genetic and epigenetic aberrations. A liquid biopsy, or blood sample, can provide the genetic landscape of all cancerous lesions (primary and metastases) as well as offering the opportunity to systematically track genomic evolution. This Review will explore how tumour-associated mutations detectable in the blood can be used in the clinic after diagnosis, including the assessment of prognosis, early detection of disease recurrence, and as surrogates for traditional biopsies with the purpose of predicting response to treatments and the development of acquired resistance.},

	abstract = {The measurement of circulating nucleic acids has transformed the management of chronic viral infections such as HIV. The development of analogous markers for individuals with cancer could similarly enhance the management of their disease. DNA containing somatic mutations is highly tumor specific and thus, in theory, can provide optimum markers. However, the number of circulating mutant gene fragments is small compared to the number of normal circulating DNA fragments, making it difficult to detect and quantify them with the sensitivity required for meaningful clinical use. In this study, we applied a highly sensitive approach to quantify circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in 162 plasma samples from 18 subjects undergoing multimodality therapy for colorectal cancer. We found that ctDNA measurements could be used to reliably monitor tumor dynamics in subjects with cancer who were undergoing surgery or chemotherapy. We suggest that this personalized genetic approach could be generally applied to individuals with other types of cancer.},

Here we present the circlize package, which provides an implementation of circular layout generation in R as well as an enhancement of available software. The flexibility of this package is based on the usage of low-level graphics functions such that self-defined high-level graphics can be easily implemented by users for specific purposes. Together with the seamless connection between the powerful computational and visual environment in R, circlize gives users more convenience and freedom to design figures for better understanding genomic patterns behind multi-dimensional data.

Let’s further assume this person performed a study with 80\% power, and that the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are equally (50\%) likely. The outcome of the study has a 2.5\% probability of being a false positive (a 50\% probability that the null hypothesis is true, multiplied by a 5\% probability of a Type 1 error), and a 40\% probability of being a true positive (a 50\% probability that the alternative hypothesis is true, multiplied by an 80\% probability of finding a significant effect). {\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div class="MsoNormal"{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div class="MsoNormal"{\textgreater}The relative evidence for H1 versus H0 is 0.40/0.025 = 16.

And let’s agree that we will conclude that whichever error impacts the strength of our evidence the most, is the most important error to control.

Not surprisingly, this happens when both types of errors are low: the alpha level is low, and the power is high (or the Type 2 error rate is low). That is why statisticians recommend low alpha levels and high power. Note that the shape of the plot remains the same regardless of the relative likelihood H1 or H0 is true, but when H1 and H0 are not equally likely (e.g., H0 is 90\% likely to be true, and H1 is 10\% likely to be true) the scale on the likelihood ratio axis increases or decreases. {\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}div class="MsoNormal"{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div class="MsoNormal"{\textgreater}\textbf{Now for the main point in this blog post}: we can see that an increase in the Type 2 error rate (or a reduction in power) reduces the evidence in our data, but it does so relatively slowly. However, we can also see that an increase in the Type 1 error rate (e.g., as a consequence of multiple comparisons without controlling for the Type 1 error rate) quickly reduces the evidence in our data. Royall {\textless}span{\textgreater}(1997){\textless}/span{\textgreater}recommends that likelihood ratios of 8 or higher provide moderate evidence, and likelihood ratios of 32 or higher provide strong evidence. Below 8, the evidence is weak and not very convincing.{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div class="MsoNormal"{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div class="MsoNormal"{\textgreater}If we calculate the likelihood ratio for alpha = 0.05, and power from 1 to 0.1 in steps of 0.1, we get the following likelihood ratios: 20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2. With 80\% power, we get the likelihood ratio of 16 we calculated above, but even 40\% power leaves us with a likelihood ratio of 8, or moderate evidence (see the figure above). If we calculate the likelihood ratio for power = 0.8 and alpha levels from 0.05 to 0.5 in steps of 0.05, we get the following likelihood ratios: 16, 8, 5.3, 4, 3.2, 2.67, 2.29, ,2, 1.78, 1.6. An alpha level of 0.1 still yields moderate evidence (assuming power is high enough!) but further inflation makes the evidence in the study very weak. {\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div class="MsoNormal"{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div class="MsoNormal"{\textgreater}To conclude: \textbf{Type 1 error rate inflation quickly destroys the evidence in your data, whereas Type 2 error inflation does so less severely.}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div class="MsoNormal"{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div class="MsoNormal"{\textgreater}Type 1 error control is important if we care about evidence.

Type 1 error control is more important than Type 2 error control, because inflating Type 1 errors will very quickly leave you with evidence that is too weak to be convincing support for your hypothesis, while inflating Type 2 errors will do so more slowly.

ANOVA只给一个P值来说明整体是否有差异，并不能告诉你差异具体在哪两个组里。要知道差异在哪里，就要用事后检验（Post-hoc）。
ANOVA原本就是用来检验多组数据的，但也可以当做T检验来比较两组数据。
Kruskal-Wallis检验和ANOVA相似，但可以用于正态性和方差齐性不明的数据。在所有非参检验中，这个算是功效低的，但跟它的参数对手（ANOVA？）比起来，相对保守。它是Mann Whitney U检验的延伸，是个秩检验，只不过用于多组数据。跟ANOVA一样，它也只给一个整体的P。
两个独立变量
比如比较药物A和药物B，在男性和女性中的疗效，则两个独立变量即为药和性别。
两因素方差分析。和单因素ANOVA的数据类型相似，但有3个原假设，1）变量1的均值相等；2）变量2的均值相等；3）这两个变量不会互相影响。
Scheirer-Ray-Hare是两因素ANOVA在非参界的对手戏，也是Kruskal-Wallis的延伸，所以假设也一样（对分布没要求，也是秩检验）。
事后检验
以上所有都只有一个P值说明整体有无差异，却不能告诉你差异在哪里。这时候需要用事后检验。且听下回分解。}

	abstract = {Microgravity has a profound effect on cardiovascular function, however, little is known about the impact of microgravity on progenitors that reside within the heart. We investigated the effect of simulated microgravity exposure on progenitors isolated from the neonatal and adult human heart by quantifying changes in functional parameters, gene expression and protein levels after 6-7 days of 2D clinorotation. Utilization of neonatal and adult cardiovascular progenitors in ground-based studies has provided novel insight into how microgravity may affect cells differently depending on age., Simulated microgravity exposure did not impact AKT or ERK phosphorylation levels and did not influence cell migration, but elevated transcripts for paracrine factors were identified in neonatal and adult cardiovascular progenitors. Age-dependent responses surfaced when comparing the impact of microgravity on differentiation. Endothelial cell tube formation was unchanged or increased in progenitors from adults whereas neonatal cardiovascular progenitors showed a decline in tube formation (p{\textless}0.05). Von Willebrand Factor, an endothelial differentiation marker, and MLC2v and Troponin T, markers for cardiomyogenic differentiation, were elevated in expression in adult progenitors after simulated microgravity. DNA repair genes and telomerase reverse transcriptase which are highly expressed in early stem cells were increased in expression in neonatal but not adult cardiac progenitors after growth under simulated microgravity conditions. Neonatal cardiac progenitors demonstrated higher levels of MESP1, OCT4, and brachyury, markers for early stem cells. MicroRNA profiling was used to further investigate the impact of simulated microgravity on cardiovascular progenitors. Fifteen microRNAs were significantly altered in expression, including microRNAs-99a and 100 (which play a critical role in cell dedifferentiation). These microRNAs were unchanged in adult cardiac progenitors., The effect of exposure to simulated microgravity in cardiovascular progenitors is age-dependent. Adult cardiac progenitors showed elevated expression of markers for endothelial and cardiomyogenic differentiation whereas neonatal progenitors acquired characteristics of dedifferentiating cells.},

	abstract = {研究背景
糖尿病视网膜病变(diabetic retinopathy, DR)是目前危害中老年人视力最主要的致盲眼病之一。DR的发生和发展与多种因素相关,如高血糖、氧化应激、糖基化终末产物、细胞凋亡、细胞因子等。近年来许多学者都明确提出免疫机制参与DR的发生发展,DR也是一种自身免疫性疾病。免疫学发病机制逐渐成为DR的研究热点,主要集中在四个方面：(1)自身抗原和免疫细胞的异常表达诱导DR的自身免疫反应[4-8]；(2)炎症细胞和前炎症因子参与DR的病理过程;(3)抗炎药物对DR具有明确的治疗作用；(4)免疫遗传因素影响DR的发生。综上所述,DR虽然以视网膜微血管病变为病理基础,但却是自身免疫应答、炎症性免疫反应、免疫遗传等在内的多因素多途径综合作用的结果。
细胞凋亡和炎症反应是DR的重要病理变化。激活诱导的细胞凋亡参与了细胞免疫状态的维持。免疫反应早期淋巴细胞被激活,进而引起细胞因子和细胞表面分子的变化,产生炎症反应。辅助性T细胞(help T cell, Th细胞)是体内一类重要的免疫调节细胞,Th细胞根据分泌细胞因子和功能不同可分为Th0、Th1、Th2、Th3、Th17亚群,其中Th1细胞主要分泌IFN-γ、Th2细胞主要分泌IL-4。Th细胞主要通过调节细胞因子表达量改变免疫状态。探讨DR患者激活诱导细胞凋亡和细胞因子的变化,可以更好的了解DR患者的免疫状态。
共刺激信号已经成为免疫学研究的一个热点领域。程序性死亡分子1(programmed death-1, PD-1)及其配体(programmed death-ligands, PD-Ls)属于CD28/B7家族,PD-1主要表达于活化的T细胞、B细胞；配体PD-L1和PD-L2主要表达于抗原提呈细胞,且PD-L1的表达更易被激活诱导。PD-1通过与PD-L1、PD-L2的IgV样结构域结合,将信号传至其细胞质区尾部的免疫受体酪氨酸抑制基序,从而抑制T细胞的活化和细胞因子的分泌。PD-1及其配体属于抑制性共刺激分子,其在自身免疫性疾病、器官移植排斥反应、病原微生物感染、肿瘤免疫逃逸等方面都发挥着重要作用[22-24]。
综上所述,免疫机制参与了DR的发生发展,PD-1/PD-Ls信号通路作为重要的免疫抑制通路,我们推测它可能对DR的发生发展具有调节作用。本课题以DR作为研究主体,以PD-1信号通路作为研究对象,以外周血作为研究靶点,从激活诱导的细胞凋亡和Thl/Th2类细胞因子出发,观察PD-1信号通路在糖尿病视网膜病变患者中的表达及功能特点,探讨PD-1/PD-Ls信号通路在DR发病机制中的作用,以期为DR的发病机制提供新的理论依据,为此类疾病的预防和和治疗提供新的思路和方法。
第一部程序性死亡分子1及其配体在糖尿病视网膜病变患者外周血中的表达
目的：探讨PD-1及其配体PD-L1和PD-L2在2型糖尿病视网膜病变患者外周血淋巴细胞中的表达和意义。
方法：临床检查确诊为增殖性糖尿病视网膜病变患者(proliferative diabetic retinopathy, PDR)41例,非增殖性糖尿病视网膜病变患者(nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, NPDR)28例,糖尿病无视网膜病变患者(diabetes mellitus and no diabetic retinopathy, DM-NDR)27例,同期行体检的健康志愿者59例纳入研究。收集受检者晨起空腹EDTA静脉抗凝血2ml,采用实时定量聚合酶链式反应(Real time polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR)检测PD-1、PD-L1、PD-L2mRNA的表达水平,分析各组间表达水平的差异。
结果：RT-PCR检测结果显示,PDR患者外周血淋巴细胞PD-1、PD-L1mRNA相对表达量比DM-NDR组及对照组降低,差异有统计学意义(PD-1: P=0.004; PD-L1:P=0.001)。PD-L2mRNA在PDR患者中也有降低的趋势,但差异无统计学意义(P=0.267)。
结论：PDR患者外周血淋巴细胞PD-1、PD-L1mRNA相对表达量降低,提示免疫应答可能参与PDR的发病机制。
第二部分程序性死亡分子1通路对糖尿病视网膜病变激活诱导的细胞凋亡调控机制的研究
目的：探讨PD-1/PD-Ls信号通路对2型糖尿病视网膜病变激活诱导的细胞凋亡(activation-induced cell death, AICD)调控的机制。
方法：临床检查确诊为PDR患者24例,DM-NDR患者15例,同期行体检的健康志愿者15例纳入研究。收集受检者晨起空腹肝素静脉抗凝血4ml,分离淋巴细胞,使用植物血凝素(phytohaemagglutinin, PHA)40μg/ml刺激淋巴细胞48小时,采用流式细胞技术检测细胞凋亡情况,观察细胞表面PD-1、PD-L1、PD-L2蛋白的表达,分析PD-1/PD-Ls信号通路对PDR患者AICD的调控。
结果：流式细胞结果显示,PDR组的细胞凋亡率高于DM-NDR组和对照组,差异有统计学意义(P=0.037,0.000), DM-NDR组的细胞凋亡率高于对照组,差异有统计学意义(P=0.048)。PDR组的PD-1蛋白表达率和凋亡细胞表面的PD-1蛋白表达率均高于DM-NDR组和对照组,差异有统计学意义(P=0.042,0.000; P=0.024,0.000), DM-NDR组的PD-1蛋白表达率和凋亡细胞表面的PD-1蛋白表达率和对照组相比,也有显著增高(P=0.031:P=0.037).PDR组的PD-L1蛋白表达率和凋亡细胞表面的PD-L1蛋白表达率均低于DM.NDR组和对照组,差异有统计学意义(P=0.000,0.009；P=-0.000,0.005),而DM.NDR组的PD-L1蛋白表达率和凋亡细胞表面的PD-L1蛋白表达率却显著高于对照组(P=-0.035；P=0.003)。三组均无PD-L2蛋白的表达。
结论：PDR患者存在激活诱导的细胞凋亡增高的现象。PD-1信号通路通过AICD介导增殖性糖尿病视网膜病变的发生发展。DM-NDR患者的PD-L1蛋白表达和PDR患者相比反而增高,提示PD-L1可能保护糖尿病患者免受眼部损害。
第三部分程序性死亡分子1通路对Th1/Th2细胞因子调控机制的研究
目的：观察2型糖尿病视网膜病变Th1/Th2类细胞因子的表达,研究PD-1信号通路对2型糖尿病视网膜病变Th1/Th2类细胞因子的调控,从细胞因子角度探讨DR的发病机制。
方法：临床检查确诊为PDR患者、DM-NDR患者和同期行体检的健康志愿者各15例纳入研究。收集受检者晨起空腹肝素静脉抗凝血4ml,分离淋巴细胞,使用50ng/ml PMA,1μg/ml Ionomycin刺激淋巴细胞4小时,1.7μg/ml Monensin固定胞内细胞因子。采用流式细胞技术检测IFN-γ和IL-4的表达；观察PDR患者Th1/Th2比值的变化；分析PDR患者PD-1和Th1/Th2类细胞因子的相关性。
结果：流式细胞结果显示,PDR组的IFN-γ和IL-4表达均高于DM-NDR组和对照组,差异有统计学意义(IFN-γ:P=0.028,0.000; IL-4:P=0.012,0.032).与DM-NDR组及对照组相比,PDR组PD-1+IFN-γ+细胞率显著增高(P=0.011,0.001),同时,PD-1+IL-4+细胞也显著增高(P=0.040,0.003)。IFN-γ+细胞和IL-4+细胞的比值在PDR组高于对照组,差异有统计学意义(P=0.047),但PD-1+IFN-γ+细胞和PD-1+IL-4+细胞的比值在各组间无差异(P=0.590)。
结论：PDR患者表现出以Thl为主的炎症反应。PD-1与PDR的Th1/Th2类细胞因子变化具有相关性,但与Th1/Th2比值变化并无关联,提示PD-1并非通过Th1/Th2失衡调控PDR的发展。
第四部分糖尿病视网膜病变危险因素的相关性分析
目的：观察PDR患者血β2微球蛋白的表达,分析血β2微球蛋白和前观察指标的相关性,探讨PD-1信号通路、凋亡、Th1/Th2类细胞因子对糖尿病微血管病变的临床预测性。
方法：使用放射免疫法检测血β2微球蛋白的表达,分析血胆微球蛋白的表达与前观察指标的相关性,前观察指标均为前部分实验中流式细胞仪检测部分的结果,包括：PD-1蛋白、PD-L1蛋白、IFN-γ、IL-4、凋亡细胞率、AnnexinV+PI-PD-1+细胞、AnnexinV+PI-PD-L1+细胞、PD-1+IFN-γ+细胞、PD-1+IL-4+细胞。
结果：PDR患者的血p2微球蛋白表达量为(3.07±1.79)mg/l,高于DM-NDR组(2.11±0.71)mg/l和对照组(1.73+0.53)mg/l,差异有统计学意义(P=0.028,0.000)。PDR患者血p2微球蛋白和凋亡细胞率(r=0.484,P=0.017)、IFN-γ(r=0.523, P=0.045)呈正相关,和PD-1蛋白(r=-0.515,P=0.034)、PD-L1蛋白(r=-0.765, P=0.004)、IL-4(r=-0.573,P=0.026)、AnnexinV+PI-PD-1+细胞率(r=-0.625,P=0.010)呈负相关。
结论：糖尿病肾病和糖尿病视网膜病变同属于微血管病变,在临床上有密切关联。PD-1信号通路和Th1/Th2类细胞因子与糖尿病微血管病变的发展有一定的相关性,为临床预测及诊断治疗提供了理论依据。},

Here, we evaluate mTOR signaling in lipid metabolism in adipose tissues of Lmna(-/-) mice, a mouse model for dilated cardiomyopathy and muscular dystrophy. Lifespan extension by rapamycin is associated with increased body weight and fat content, two phenotypes we link to suppression of elevated energy expenditure. In both white and brown adipose tissue of Lmna(-/-) mice, we find that rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 but not mTORC2, leading to suppression of elevated lipolysis and restoration of thermogenic protein UCP1 levels, respectively. The short lifespan and metabolic phenotypes of Lmna(-/-) mice can be partially rescued by maintaining mice at thermoneutrality. Together, our findings indicate that altered mTOR signaling in Lmna(-/-) mice leads to a lipodystrophic phenotype that can be rescued with rapamycin, highlighting the effect of loss of adipose tissue in Lmna(-/-) mice and the consequences of altered mTOR signaling.},

Apart from a role for dopamine deficiency in some forms, the cellular mechanisms underlying most dystonias are currently unknown. Here, we discover a role for deficient eIF2α signaling in DYT1 dystonia, a rare inherited generalized form, through a genome-wide RNAi screen. Subsequent experiments including patient-derived cells and a mouse model support both a pathogenic role and therapeutic potential for eIF2α pathway perturbations. We further find genetic and functional evidence supporting similar pathway impairment in patients with sporadic cervical dystonia, due to rare coding variation in the eIF2α effector ATF4. Considering also that another dystonia, DYT16, involves a gene upstream of the eIF2α pathway, these results mechanistically link multiple forms of dystonia and put forth a new overall cellular mechanism for dystonia pathogenesis, impairment of eIF2α signaling, a pathway known for its roles in cellular stress responses and synaptic plasticity.},

In natural populations, both sexes may encounter affected as well as unaffected individuals during the breeding season, and any diminution in attractiveness could compromise reproductive success. Here we examine mate preference in male and female rats whose progenitors had been treated with the antiandrogenic fungicide vinclozolin. This effect is sex-specific, and we demonstrate that females three generations removed from the exposure discriminate and prefer males who do not have a history of exposure, whereas similarly epigenetically imprinted males do not exhibit such a preference. The observations suggest that the consequences of EDCs are not just transgenerational but can be “transpopulational”, because in many mammalian species, males are the dispersing sex. This result indicates that epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of EDC action represents an unappreciated force in sexual selection. Our observations provide direct experimental evidence for a role of epigenetics as a determinant factor in evolution.},

	doi = {10.2164/jandrol.106.000349},
	abstract = {The current study was designed to examine the actions of a model endocrine disruptor on embryonic testis development and male fertility. Pregnant rats (F0) that received a transient embryonic exposure to an environmental endocrine disruptor, vinclozolin, had male offspring (F1) with reduced spermatogenic capacity. The reduced spermatogenetic capacity observed in the F1 male offspring was transmitted to the subsequent generations (F2-F4). The administration of vinclozolin, an androgen receptor antagonist, at 100 mg/kg/day from embryonic day 8-14 (E8-E14) of pregnancy to only the F0 dam resulted in a transgenerational phenotype in the subsequent male offspring in the F1-F4 generations. The litter size and male/female sex ratios were similar in controls and the vinclozolin generations. The average testes/body weight index of the postnatal day 60 (P60) males was not significantly different in the vinclozolin-treated generations compared to the controls. However, the testicular spermatid number, as well as the epididymal sperm number and motility, were significantly reduced in the vinclozolin generations compared to the control animals. Postnatal day 20 (P20) testis from the vinclozolin F2 generation had no morphological abnormalities, but did have an increase in spermatogenic cell apoptosis. Although the P60 testis morphology was predominantly normal, the germ cell apoptosis was significantly increased in the testes cross sections of animals from the vinclozolin generations. The increase in apoptosis was stage-specific in the testis, with tubules at stages IX-XIV having the highest increase in apoptotic germ cells. The tubules at stages I-V also had an increase in apoptotic germ cells compared to the control samples, but tubules at stages VI-VIII had no increase in apoptotic germ cells. An outcross of a vinclozolin generation male with a wild-type female demonstrated that the reduced spermatogenic cell phenotype was transmitted through the male germ line. An outcross with a vinclozolin generation female with a wild-type male had no phenotype. A similar phenotype was observed in outbred Sprague Dawley and inbred Fisher rat strains. Observations demonstrate that a transient exposure at the time of male sex determination to the antiandrogenic endocrine disruptor vinclozolin can induce an apparent epigenetic transgenerational phenotype with reduced spermatogenic capacity.},

The primary molecular component currently considered for neo-Darwinian evolution involves genetic alterations and random mutations that generate the phenotypic variation required for natural selection to act. The vast majority of environmental factors cannot directly alter DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms directly regulate genetic processes and can be dramatically altered by environmental factors. Therefore, environmental epigenetics provides a molecular mechanism to directly alter phenotypic variation generationally. Lamarck proposed in 1802 the concept that environment can directly alter phenotype in a heritable manner. Environmental epigenetics and epigenetic transgenerational inheritance provide molecular mechanisms for this process. Therefore, environment can on a molecular level influence the phenotypic variation directly. The ability of environmental epigenetics to alter phenotypic and genotypic variation directly can significantly impact natural selection. Neo-Lamarckian concept can facilitate neo-Darwinian evolution. A unified theory of evolution is presented to describe the integration of environmental epigenetic and genetic aspects of evolution.},

	abstract = {Tardigrades (/ˈtɑːrdɪˌɡreɪd/; also known as water bears or moss piglets) are water-dwelling, eight-legged, segmented micro-animals. They were first discovered by the German zoologist Johann August Ephraim Goeze in 1773. The name Tardigrada (meaning "slow stepper") was given three years later by the Italian biologist Lazzaro Spallanzani. They have been found everywhere from mountaintops to the deep sea, from tropical rain forests to the Antarctic.
Tardigrades are notable for being the most resilient animal: they can survive extreme conditions that would be rapidly fatal to nearly all other known life forms. They can withstand temperature ranges from 1 K (−458 °F; −272 °C) (close to absolute zero) to about 420 K (300 °F; 150 °C), pressures about six times greater than those found in the deepest ocean trenches, ionizing radiation at doses hundreds of times higher than the lethal dose for a human, and the vacuum of outer space. They can go without food or water for more than 30 years, drying out to the point where they are 3\% or less water, only to rehydrate, forage, and reproduce.
They are not considered extremophilic because they are not adapted to exploit these conditions. This means that their chances of dying increase the longer they are exposed to the extreme environments, whereas true extremophiles thrive in a physically or geochemically extreme environment that would harm most other organisms.
Usually, tardigrades are about 0.5 mm (0.02 in) long when they are fully grown. They are short and plump with four pairs of legs, each with four to eight claws also known as "disks". The first three pairs of legs are directed ventrolaterally and are the primary means of locomotion (moving), while the fourth pair is directed posteriorly on the terminal segment of the trunk and is used primarily for grasping the substrate. Tardigrades are prevalent in mosses and lichens and feed on plant cells, algae, and small invertebrates. When collected, they may be viewed under a very low-power microscope, making them accessible to students and amateur scientists.
Tardigrades form the phylum Tardigrada, part of the superphylum Ecdysozoa. It is an ancient group, with fossils dating from 530 million years ago, in the Cambrian period. About 1,150 species of tardigrades have been described. Tardigrades can be found throughout the world, from the Himalayas (above 6,000 m (20,000 ft)), to the deep sea (below 4,000 m (13,000 ft)) and from the polar regions to the equator.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of literature comparing Bayesian analytic techniques with traditional approaches for analyzing clinical trials using real trial data.
METHODS: We compared Bayesian and frequentist group sequential methods using data from two published clinical trials. We chose two widely accepted frequentist rules, O'Brien-Fleming and Lan-DeMets, and conjugate Bayesian priors. Using the nonparametric bootstrap, we estimated a sampling distribution of stopping times for each method. Because current practice dictates the preservation of an experiment-wise false positive rate (Type I error), we approximated these error rates for our Bayesian and frequentist analyses with the posterior probability of detecting an effect in a simulated null sample. Thus for the data-generated distribution represented by these trials, we were able to compare the relative performance of these techniques.
RESULTS: No final outcomes differed from those of the original trials. However, the timing of trial termination differed substantially by method and varied by trial. For one trial, group sequential designs of either type dictated early stopping of the study. In the other, stopping times were dependent upon the choice of spending function and prior distribution.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that trialists ought to consider Bayesian methods in addition to traditional approaches for analysis of clinical trials. Though findings from this small sample did not demonstrate either method to consistently outperform the other, they did suggest the need to replicate these comparisons using data from varied clinical trials in order to determine the conditions under which the different methods would be most efficient.},

	abstract = {A typical rule that has been used for the endorsement of new medications by the Food and Drug Administration is to have two trials, each convincing on its own, demonstrating effectiveness. "Convincing" may be subjectively interpreted, but the use of p-values and the focus on statistical significance (in particular with p {\textless} .05 being coined significant) is pervasive in clinical research. Therefore, in this paper, we calculate with simulations what it means to have exactly two trials, each with p {\textless} .05, in terms of the actual strength of evidence quantified by Bayes factors. Our results show that different cases where two trials have a p-value below .05 have wildly differing Bayes factors. Bayes factors of at least 20 in favor of the alternative hypothesis are not necessarily achieved and they fail to be reached in a large proportion of cases, in particular when the true effect size is small (0.2 standard deviations) or zero. In a non-trivial number of cases, evidence actually points to the null hypothesis, in particular when the true effect size is zero, when the number of trials is large, and when the number of participants in both groups is low. We recommend use of Bayes factors as a routine tool to assess endorsement of new medications, because Bayes factors consistently quantify strength of evidence. Use of p-values may lead to paradoxical and spurious decision-making regarding the use of new medications.},

To know whether a non-significant result counts against a theory, or if it just indicates data insensitivity, researchers must use one of: power, intervals (such as confidence or credibility intervals), or else an indicator of the relative evidence for one theory over another, such as a Bayes factor. I argue Bayes factors allow theory to be linked to data in a way that overcomes the weaknesses of the other approaches. Specifically, Bayes factors use the data themselves to determine their sensitivity in distinguishing theories (unlike power), and they make use of those aspects of a theory’s predictions that are often easiest to specify (unlike power and intervals, which require specifying the minimal interesting value in order to address theory). Bayes factors provide a coherent approach to determining whether non-significant results support a null hypothesis over a theory, or whether the data are just insensitive. They allow accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis to be put on an equal footing. Concrete examples are provided to indicate the range of application of a simple online Bayes calculator, which reveal both the strengths and weaknesses of Bayes factors.},

	abstract = {In this work we propose the adoption of a statistical framework used in the evaluation of forensic evidence as a tool for evaluating and presenting circumstantial "evidence" of a disease outbreak from syndromic surveillance. The basic idea is to exploit the predicted distributions of reported cases to calculate the ratio of the likelihood of observing n cases given an ongoing outbreak over the likelihood of observing n cases given no outbreak. The likelihood ratio defines the Value of Evidence (V). Using Bayes' rule, the prior odds for an ongoing outbreak are multiplied by V to obtain the posterior odds. This approach was applied to time series on the number of horses showing clinical respiratory symptoms or neurological symptoms. The separation between prior beliefs about the probability of an outbreak and the strength of evidence from syndromic surveillance offers a transparent reasoning process suitable for supporting decision makers. The value of evidence can be translated into a verbal statement, as often done in forensics or used for the production of risk maps. Furthermore, a Bayesian approach offers seamless integration of data from syndromic surveillance with results from predictive modeling and with information from other sources such as disease introduction risk assessments.},

	abstract = {PD-1 expression in peripheral blood T-cells has been reported in several kinds of cancers, including lung cancer. However, the relationship between PD-1 expression in peripheral blood T-cells and prognosis after treatment with a cancer vaccine has not been reported. To elucidate this relationship, we analyzed PD-1 expression in the peripheral blood T-cells of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The blood samples used in this study were obtained from patients enrolled in phase II clinical trials of a personalized peptide vaccine. Seventy-eight samples obtained before and after a single vaccination cycle (consisting of six or eight doses) were subjected to the analysis. PD-1 was expressed on lymphocytes in the majority of samples. The relative contents of PD1(+) CD4(+) T-cells against total lymphocytes before and after the vaccination cycle correlated with overall survival (OS) with a high degree of statistical significance (P {\textless} 0.0001 and P = 0.0014). A decrease in PD-1(+) CD8(+) T-cells after one cycle of vaccination also correlated with longer OS (P = 0.032). The IgG response to the non-vaccinated peptides suggested that the epitope spreading seemed to occur more frequently in high-PD-1(+) CD4(+) T-cell groups. Enrichment of CD45RA(-) CCR7(-) effector-memory phenotype cells in PD-1(+) T-cells in PBMCs was also shown. These results suggest that PD-1 expression on the peripheral blood T-cell subsets can become a new prognostic marker in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with personalized peptide vaccination.},

In two independent cohorts, higher nonsynonymous mutation burden in tumors was associated with improved objective response, durable clinical benefit, and progression-free survival. Efficacy also correlated with the molecular smoking signature, higher neoantigen burden, and DNA repair pathway mutations; each factor was also associated with mutation burden.

METHODS: We analysed a cohort of 125 NSCLC patients, including 56 EGFR mutated, 29 KRAS mutated, 10 ALK translocated and 30 EGFR/KRAS/ALK wild type. PD-L1 and PD-1 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry. All cases with moderate or strong staining (2+/3+) in {\textgreater}5\% of tumour cells were considered as positive.
RESULTS: PD-1 positive (+) was significantly associated with current smoking status (P=0.02) and with the presence of KRAS mutations (P=0.006), whereas PD-L1+ was significantly associated to adenocarcinoma histology (P=0.005) and with presence of EGFR mutations (P=0.001).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate determination of protein complexes has become a key task of system biology for revealing cellular organization and function. Up to now, the protein complex prediction methods are mostly focused on static protein protein interaction (PPI) networks. However, cellular systems are highly dynamic and responsive to cues from the environment. The shift from static PPI networks to dynamic PPI networks is essential to accurately predict protein complex.
RESULTS: The gene expression data contains crucial dynamic information of proteins and PPIs, along with high-throughput experimental PPI data, are valuable for protein complex prediction. Firstly, we exploit gene expression data to calculate the active time point and the active probability of each protein and PPI. The dynamic active information is integrated into high-throughput PPI data to construct dynamic PPI networks. Secondly, a novel method for predicting protein complexes from the dynamic PPI networks is proposed based on core-attachment structural feature. Our method can effectively exploit not only the dynamic active information but also the topology structure information based on the dynamic PPI networks.
CONCLUSIONS: We construct four dynamic PPI networks, and accurately predict many well-characterized protein complexes. The experimental results show that (i) the dynamic active information significantly improves the performance of protein complex prediction; (ii) our method can effectively make good use of both the dynamic active information and the topology structure information of dynamic PPI networks to achieve state-of-the-art protein complex prediction capabilities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The timing of the circulatory determination of death for organ donation presents a medical and ethical challenge. Concerns have been raised about the timing of electrocerebral inactivity in relation to the cessation of circulatory function in organ donation after cardio-circulatory death. Nonprocessed electroencephalographic (EEG) measures have not been characterized and may provide insight into neurological function during this process.
METHODS: We assessed electrocortical data in relation to cardiac function after withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and in the postmortem period after cardiac arrest for four patients in a Canadian intensive care unit. Subhairline EEG and cardio-circulatory monitoring including electrocardiogram, arterial blood pressure (ABP), and oxygen saturation were captured.
RESULTS: Electrocerebral inactivity preceded the cessation of the cardiac rhythm and ABP in three patients. In one patient, single delta wave bursts persisted following the cessation of both the cardiac rhythm and ABP. There was a significant difference in EEG amplitude between the 30-minute period before and the 5-minute period following ABP cessation for the group, but we did not observe any well-defined EEG states following the early cardiac arrest period.
CONCLUSIONS: In a case series of four patients, EEG inactivity preceded electrocardiogram and ABP inactivity during the dying process in three patients. Further study of the electroencephalogram during the withdrawal of life sustaining therapies will add clarity to medical, ethical, and legal concerns for donation after circulatory determined death.},

	abstract = {Apoptosis and hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes are the primary causes of heart failure and are known to be regulated by complex interactions in the underlying intracellular signaling network. Previous experimental studies were successful in identifying some key signaling components, but most of the findings were confined to particular experimental conditions corresponding to specific cellular contexts. A question then arises as to whether there might be essential regulatory interactions that prevail across diverse cellular contexts. To address this question, we have constructed a large-scale cardiac signaling network by integrating previous experimental results and developed a mathematical model using normalized ordinary differential equations. Specific cellular contexts were reflected to different kinetic parameters sampled from random distributions. Through extensive computer simulations with various parameter distributions, we revealed the five most essential context-independent regulatory interactions (between: (1) αAR and Gαq, (2) IP3 and calcium, (3) epac and CaMK, (4) JNK and NFAT, and (5) p38 and NFAT) for hypertrophy and apoptosis that were consistently found over all our perturbation analyses. These essential interactions are expected to be the most promising therapeutic targets across a broad spectrum of individual conditions of heart failure patients.},

	abstract = {Background Smokers tend to consume more coffee than non-smokers and there is evidence for a positive relationship between cigarette and coffee consumption in smokers. Cigarette smoke increases the metabolism of caffeine, so this association may represent a causal effect of smoking on caffeine intake. Methods We performed a Mendelian randomisation analysis in 114,029 individuals from the UK Biobank, 56,664 from the Norwegian HUNT study and 78,650 from the Copenhagen General Population Study. We used a genetic variant in the CHRNA5 nicotinic receptor (rs16969968) as a proxy for smoking heaviness. Coffee and tea consumption were self-reported. Analyses were conducted using linear regression and meta-analysed across studies. Results Each additional cigarette per day consumed by current smokers was associated with higher coffee consumption (0.10 cups per day, 95\% CI:0.03,0.17). There was weak evidence for an increase in tea consumption per additional cigarette smoked per day (0.04 cups per day, 95\% CI:-0.002,0.07). There was strong evidence that each additional copy of the minor allele of rs16969968 (which increases daily cigarette consumption) in current smokers was associated with higher coffee consumption (0.15 cups per day, 95\% CI:0.11,0.20), but only weak evidence for an association with tea consumption (0.04 cups per day, 95\% CI:-0.01,0.09). There was no clear evidence that rs16969968 was associated with coffee or tea consumption in never or former smokers. Conclusion These findings suggest that higher cigarette consumption causally increases coffee intake. This is consistent with faster metabolism of caffeine by smokers, but may also reflect behavioural links between smoking and coffee.},

In practice, this comparison is often based on an incorrect procedure involving two separate tests in which researchers conclude that effects differ when one effect is significant (P {\textless} 0.05) but the other is not (P {\textgreater} 0.05). We reviewed 513 behavioral, systems and cognitive neuroscience articles in five top-ranking journals (Science, Nature, Nature Neuroscience, Neuron and The Journal of Neuroscience) and found that 78 used the correct procedure and 79 used the incorrect procedure. An additional analysis suggests that incorrect analyses of interactions are even more common in cellular and molecular neuroscience. We discuss scenarios in which the erroneous procedure is particularly beguiling.},

More important, we found signatures of damage in most sequencing data sets in widely used resources, including the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas, establishing damage as a pervasive cause of sequencing errors. The extent of this damage directly confounds the determination of somatic variants in these data sets.},

伦敦大学玛丽皇后学院，学物理。第三年搞个人课题，不用去做常规实验。由Dr jack G Powles给他定题，要建一个携带式NMR分光计去检测地球磁场。这个之前有人用阀门技术(valve technology)做过了，但他要用晶体管。当时对它知之甚少，都还没走进物理课堂，倒是擅长阀门技术。不过很enjoy这个课题，学到了很多。快毕业的时候，Jack Powles向他拋出了橄榄枝，进了课题组研究NMR。
那时Jack是Physics杂志的审稿人（Reader？？），在课题中他发现了后来被称为“固体回声（solid echoes）”的东西。三年博士学习快结束的时候才整出一篇短论文，描述他们在石膏的单晶体结构中发现的固体回声。
毕业前，Jack给他联系到了美国伊利诺伊大学的Charlie Slichter教授门下一职，问他是否有兴趣去做博士后研究。

	volume = {316},
	issn = {1538-3598},
	doi = {10.1001/jama.2016.17216},
	abstract = {Importance: Deep learning is a family of computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from a large set of examples that demonstrate the desired behavior, removing the need to specify rules explicitly. Application of these methods to medical imaging requires further assessment and validation.
Objective: To apply deep learning to create an algorithm for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema in retinal fundus photographs.
Design and Setting: A specific type of neural network optimized for image classification called a deep convolutional neural network was trained using a retrospective development data set of 128 175 retinal images, which were graded 3 to 7 times for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and image gradability by a panel of 54 US licensed ophthalmologists and ophthalmology senior residents between May and December 2015. The resultant algorithm was validated in January and February 2016 using 2 separate data sets, both graded by at least 7 US board-certified ophthalmologists with high intragrader consistency.
Exposure: Deep learning-trained algorithm.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR), defined as moderate and worse diabetic retinopathy, referable diabetic macular edema, or both, were generated based on the reference standard of the majority decision of the ophthalmologist panel. The algorithm was evaluated at 2 operating points selected from the development set, one selected for high specificity and another for high sensitivity.
Results: The EyePACS-1 data set consisted of 9963 images from 4997 patients (mean age, 54.4 years; 62.2\% women; prevalence of RDR, 683/8878 fully gradable images [7.8\%]); the Messidor-2 data set had 1748 images from 874 patients (mean age, 57.6 years; 42.6\% women; prevalence of RDR, 254/1745 fully gradable images [14.6\%]). For detecting RDR, the algorithm had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.991 (95\% CI, 0.988-0.993) for EyePACS-1 and 0.990 (95\% CI, 0.986-0.995) for Messidor-2. Using the first operating cut point with high specificity, for EyePACS-1, the sensitivity was 90.3\% (95\% CI, 87.5\%-92.7\%) and the specificity was 98.1\% (95\% CI, 97.8\%-98.5\%). For Messidor-2, the sensitivity was 87.0\% (95\% CI, 81.1\%-91.0\%) and the specificity was 98.5\% (95\% CI, 97.7\%-99.1\%). Using a second operating point with high sensitivity in the development set, for EyePACS-1 the sensitivity was 97.5\% and specificity was 93.4\% and for Messidor-2 the sensitivity was 96.1\% and specificity was 93.9\%.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this evaluation of retinal fundus photographs from adults with diabetes, an algorithm based on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. Further research is necessary to determine the feasibility of applying this algorithm in the clinical setting and to determine whether use of the algorithm could lead to improved care and outcomes compared with current ophthalmologic assessment.},

	abstract = {Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images—two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets—consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion smartphone subscriptions will exist by the year 2021 (ref. 13) and can therefore potentially provide low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8\% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the past 30 years, the international conference on Artificial Intelligence in MEdicine (AIME) has been organized at different venues across Europe every 2 years, establishing a forum for scientific exchange and creating an active research community. The Artificial Intelligence in Medicine journal has published theme issues with extended versions of selected AIME papers since 1998.
OBJECTIVES: To review the history of AIME conferences, investigate its impact on the wider research field, and identify challenges for its future.
METHODS: We analyzed a total of 122 session titles to create a taxonomy of research themes and topics. We classified all 734 AIME conference papers published between 1985 and 2013 with this taxonomy. We also analyzed the citations to these conference papers and to 55 special issue papers.
RESULTS: We identified 30 research topics across 12 themes. AIME was dominated by knowledge engineering research in its first decade, while machine learning and data mining prevailed thereafter. Together these two themes have contributed about 51\% of all papers. There have been eight AIME papers that were cited at least 10 times per year since their publication.
CONCLUSIONS: There has been a major shift from knowledge-based to data-driven methods while the interest for other research themes such as uncertainty management, image and signal processing, and natural language processing has been stable since the early 1990s. AIME papers relating to guidelines and protocols are among the most highly cited.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Pathologists' daily tasks consist of both the professional interpretation of slides and the secretarial tasks of translating these interpretations into final pathology reports, the latter of which is a time-consuming endeavor for most pathologists.
OBJECTIVE: To describe an artificial intelligence that performs secretarial tasks, designated as Secretary-Mimicking Artificial Intelligence (SMILE).
DESIGN: The underling implementation of SMILE is a collection of computer programs that work in concert to "listen to" the voice commands and to "watch for" the changes of windows caused by slide bar code scanning; SMILE responds to these inputs by acting upon PowerPath Client windows (Sunquest Information Systems, Tucson, Arizona) and its Microsoft Word (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington) Add-In window, eventuating in the reports being typed and finalized. Secretary-Mimicking Artificial Intelligence also communicates relevant information to the pathologist via the computer speakers and message box on the screen.
RESULTS: Secretary-Mimicking Artificial Intelligence performs many secretarial tasks intelligently and semiautonomously, with rapidity and consistency, thus enabling pathologists to focus on slide interpretation, which results in a marked increase in productivity, decrease in errors, and reduction of stress in daily practice. Secretary-Mimicking Artificial Intelligence undergoes encounter-based learning continually, resulting in a continuous improvement in its knowledge-based intelligence.
CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence for pathologists is both feasible and powerful. The future widespread use of artificial intelligence in our profession is certainly going to transform how we practice pathology.},

Deep learning has advanced rapidly since the early 2000s and now demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in various fields. Accordingly, application of deep learning in bioinformatics to gain insight from data has been emphasized in both academia and industry. Here, we review deep learning in bioinformatics, presenting examples of current research. To provide a useful and comprehensive perspective, we categorize research both by the bioinformatics domain (i.e. omics, biomedical imaging, biomedical signal processing) and deep learning architecture (i.e. deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, emergent architectures) and present brief descriptions of each study. Additionally, we discuss theoretical and practical issues of deep learning in bioinformatics and suggest future research directions. We believe that this review will provide valuable insights and serve as a starting point for researchers to apply deep learning approaches in their bioinformatics studies.},

AI不仅能判断CC，还能对CC进行严重程度的评估和风险分层，提供治疗建议（手术还是随访观察）。476例健康眼和410例CC随机分成5组，用前4组做标准正交试验训练CNN，第5组则让它诊断，跟眼科专家PK，重复5次。
AI判断的正确率99\%，对CC病例的治疗建议的正确率97\%。对晶体混浊程度的判断，准确率有94-95\%。
此后进了4年的I期临床试验，14例CC患者和43例健康儿童，CNN用判断的这57张眼底图片并未用于它的训练，对新病例的诊断确实达到了98\%，治疗建议的正确率有93\%，晶体混浊判断93-100\%正确。以专家团的判断为基准比较，专家不知道CNN的判断。（bug：专家不会出错吗？）
再从网上收集40例CC图片和13例正常图片，质量不齐。CNN的准确率有轻度下降，保持在85-95\%之间。
这一切表明，AI诊断CC是有现实意义的。
然而CC在人群中的发病率只有1\%，所以大家又用100张健康图片混入1张CC图片，进行3组测试，CNN还是揪了出来，给出了正确的严重程度评做的治疗建议，正确率100\%。
然后又用50张各种临床疑难眼底图让CNN测试，CNN的错误率（9个假阳性和4个假阴性）都比3个不同专科的眼科专家低（表现最好的专家还错了16个）。All three ophthalmologists misidentified one particular case with a highly illuminated lens that came immediately after the assessment of a particularly dark yet healthy lens; the CNNs correctly classified the particular ocular image as normal.（？？）
跟其他医院进行云合作。
CC这样的罕见病，本来案例就少，很难进行基于数据的基础研究，但相比于之前用大量数据的训练法，本例只用相对少的数量就可达到较高的预测准确率，为罕见病的监控提供新的出路。
最近另有报道称AI也可以眼底图像为指标诊断糖网。除此之外，AI也被广泛用于医学影像诊断。}

Key insights into human behavioral tasks can often be obtained by using appropriate animal models. We report here that pigeons (Columba livia)—which share many visual system properties with humans—can serve as promising surrogate observers of medical images, a capability not previously documented. The birds proved to have a remarkable ability to distinguish benign from malignant human breast histopathology after training with differential food reinforcement; even more importantly, the pigeons were able to generalize what they had learned when confronted with novel image sets. The birds’ histological accuracy, like that of humans, was modestly affected by the presence or absence of color as well as by degrees of image compression, but these impacts could be ameliorated with further training. Turning to radiology, the birds proved to be similarly capable of detecting cancer-relevant microcalcifications on mammogram images. However, when given a different (and for humans quite difficult) task—namely, classification of suspicious mammographic densities (masses)—the pigeons proved to be capable only of image memorization and were unable to successfully generalize when shown novel examples. The birds’ successes and difficulties suggest that pigeons are well-suited to help us better understand human medical image perception, and may also prove useful in performance assessment and development of medical imaging hardware, image processing, and image analysis tools.},

In the randomised trial the difference (topical minus oral) was two points (95\% confidence interval −2 to 6); in the preference study, it was one point (−4 to 6). There were no differences in major adverse effects in the trial or study. The only significant differences in secondary outcomes were in the randomised trial. The oral group had more respiratory adverse effects (17\% v 7\%,95\% confidence interval for difference −17\% to −2\%), the change in serum creatinine was 3.7 mmol/l less favourable (0.9 µmol/l to 6.5 µmol/l); and more participants changed treatments because of adverse effects (16\% v 1\%, −16\% to −5\%). In the topical group more participants had chronic pain grade III or IV at three months, and more participants changed treatment because of ineffectiveness., Conclusions Advice to use oral or topical preparations has an equivalent effect on knee pain over one year, and there are more minor side effects with oral NSAIDs. Topical NSAIDs may be a useful alternative to oral NSAIDs., Trial registration ISRCTN 79353052.},

	abstract = {The Western blot techniques that were originally established in the late 1970s are still actively utilized today. However, this traditional method of Western blotting has several drawbacks that include low quality resolution, spurious bands, decreased sensitivity, and poor protein integrity. Recent advances have drastically improved numerous aspects of the standard Western blot protocol to produce higher qualitative and quantitative data. The Bis-Tris gel system, an alternative to the conventional Laemmli system, generates better protein separation and resolution, maintains protein integrity, and reduces electrophoresis to a 35 min run time. Moreover, the iBlot dry blotting system, dramatically improves the efficacy and speed of protein transfer to the membrane in 7 min, which is in contrast to the traditional protein transfer methods that are often more inefficient with lengthy transfer times. In combination with these highly innovative modifications, protein detection using infrared fluorescent imaging results in higher-quality, more accurate and consistent data compared to the standard Western blotting technique of chemiluminescence. This technology can simultaneously detect two different antigens on the same membrane by utilizing two-color near-infrared dyes that are visualized in different fluorescent channels. Furthermore, the linearity and broad dynamic range of fluorescent imaging allows for the precise quantification of both strong and weak protein bands. Thus, this protocol describes the key improvements to the classic Western blotting method, in which these advancements significantly increase the quality of data while greatly reducing the performance time of this experiment.},

In this article, the author uses his own experience to examine issues that arise when investigators are falsely accused of scientific fraud. Investigators must understand the processes in place to protect themselves against false accusations. The present system takes a position of guilty until proven innocent, a concept that is antithetical to American principles of jurisprudence. Yet this stance is acceptable as a requirement for membership in the scientific community, more reflective of the rules within a guild organization. The necessity for proof of innocence by members of the scientific community carries obligations that transcend normal legal assumptions. Scientists must safeguard their reputations by organizing and maintaining all original image files and data relevant to publications and grant proposals. Investigators must be able to provide clear documentation rapidly whenever concerns are raised during the review process. Moreover, peer-reviewed journals must be diligent not only in the identification of fraud but also in providing rapid due process for adjudication of allegations. The success of the scientific guild rules of conduct lies in the practice of due diligence by both scientists and journal editors in questions of scientific misconduct.},

	abstract = {Digital imaging has provided scientists with new opportunities to acquire and manipulate data using techniques that were difficult or impossible to employ in the past. Because digital images are easier to manipulate than film images, new problems have emerged. One growing concern in the scientific community is that digital images are not being handled with sufficient care. The problem is twofold: (1) the very small, yet troubling, number of intentional falsifications that have been identified, and (2) the more common unintentional, inappropriate manipulation of images for publication. Journals and professional societies have begun to address the issue with specific digital imaging guidelines. Unfortunately, the guidelines provided often do not come with instructions to explain their importance. Thus they deal with what should or should not be done, but not the associated ‘why’ that is required for understanding the rules. This article proposes 12 guidelines for scientific digital image manipulation and discusses the technical reasons behind these guidelines. These guidelines can be incorporated into lab meetings and graduate student training in order to provoke discussion and begin to bring an end to the culture of “data beautification”.},

	abstract = {Wireless diabetes control? There’s an app for that
In an elegant feat of synthetic biology, Shao et al. were able to remotely control release of glucose-lowering hormones by engineered cells implanted into diabetic mice. These designer cells were transfected with optogenetic circuits, which enabled them to produce the hormones in response to far-red light. A smartphone could adjust far-red light intensity and duration with the help from a control box. Implanting hydrogel capsules containing both engineered cells and light-emitting diode light sources provided a semiautonomous system that maintained glucose homeostasis over several weeks in the diabetic mice. This study illuminates the potential of cell-based therapies.
With the increasingly dominant role of smartphones in our lives, mobile health care systems integrating advanced point-of-care technologies to manage chronic diseases are gaining attention. Using a multidisciplinary design principle coupling electrical engineering, software development, and synthetic biology, we have engineered a technological infrastructure enabling the smartphone-assisted semiautomatic treatment of diabetes in mice. A custom-designed home server SmartController was programmed to process wireless signals, enabling a smartphone to regulate hormone production by optically engineered cells implanted in diabetic mice via a far-red light (FRL)–responsive optogenetic interface. To develop this wireless controller network, we designed and implanted hydrogel capsules carrying both engineered cells and wirelessly powered FRL LEDs (light-emitting diodes). In vivo production of a short variant of human glucagon-like peptide 1 (shGLP-1) or mouse insulin by the engineered cells in the hydrogel could be remotely controlled by smartphone programs or a custom-engineered Bluetooth-active glucometer in a semiautomatic, glucose-dependent manner. By combining electronic device–generated digital signals with optogenetically engineered cells, this study provides a step toward translating cell-based therapies into the clinic.
Optogenetically engineered cells maintain blood glucose homeostasis in mice by semiautonomous, wirelessly regulated exposure to far-red light.

In addition, the author lists different strategies for successful revision. Each of those strategies represents a step in the revision process and should help the writer improve the quality of the manuscript. The paper could be considered a brief manual for publication.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0144980},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses conducted via the Cochrane Collaboration adhere to strict methodological and reporting standards aiming to minimize bias, maximize transparency/reproducibility, and improve the accuracy of summarized data. Whether this results in differences in the results reported by meta-analyses on the same topic conducted outside the Cochrane Collaboration is an open question.
METHODS: We conducted a matched-pair analysis with individual meta-analyses as the unit of analysis, comparing Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews. Using meta-analyses from the cardiovascular literature, we identified pairs that matched on intervention and outcome. The pairs were contrasted in terms of how frequently results disagreed between the Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews, whether effect sizes and statistical precision differed systematically, and how these differences related to the frequency of secondary citations of those reviews.
RESULTS: Our search yielded 40 matched pairs of reviews. The two sets were similar in terms of which was first to publication, how many studies were included, and average sample sizes. The paired reviews included a total of 344 individual clinical trials: 111 (32.3\%) studies were included only in a Cochrane review, 104 (30.2\%) only in a non-Cochrane review, and 129 (37.5\%) in both. Stated another way, 62.5\% of studies were only included in one or the other meta-analytic literature. Overall, 37.5\% of pairs had discrepant results. The most common involved shifts in the width of 95\% confidence intervals that would yield a different statistical interpretation of the significance of results (7 pairs). Additionally, 20\% differed in the direction of the summary effect size (5 pairs) or reported greater than a 2-fold difference in its magnitude (3 pairs). Non-Cochrane reviews reported significantly higher effect sizes (P{\textless} 0.001) and lower precision (P{\textless}0.001) than matched Cochrane reviews. Reviews reporting an effect size at least 2-fold greater than their matched pair were cited more frequently.
CONCLUSION: Though results between topic-matched Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews were quite similar, discrepant results were frequent, and the overlap of included studies was surprisingly low. Non-Cochrane reviews report larger effect sizes with lower precision than Cochrane reviews, indicating systematic differences, likely reflective of methodology, between the two types of reviews that could generate different interpretations of the interventions under question.},

	abstract = {The present work is an overview of the main pitfalls which may occur when a researcher performs a meta-analysis. The main goal is to help clinicians evaluate published research results. Organizing and carrying out a meta-analysis is hard work, but the findings can be significant. Meta-analysis is a powerful tool to cumulate and summarize the knowledge in a research field, and to identify the overall measure of a treatment’s effect by combining several conclusions. However, it is a controversial tool, because even small violations of  certain rules can lead to misleading conclusions. In fact, several decisions made when designing and performing a meta-analysis require personal judgment and expertise, thus creating personal biases or expectations that may influence the result. Meta-analysis’ conclusions should be interpreted in the light of various checks, discussed in this work, which can inform the readers of the likely reliability of the conclusions. Specifically, we explore the principal steps (from writing a prospective protocol of analysis to results’ interpretation) in order to minimize the risk of conducting a mediocre meta-analysis and to support researchers to accurately evaluate the published findings.},

视神经分为四段：1）球内段（视神经头或视盘），2）眶内段，3）管内段，4）颅内段。球内段又可细分为筛板前段（前部），筛板段（中部），筛板后段（后部）。
NAION的描述：视盘水肿充血，边缘模糊，血管暗淡( obscuration )。可见视盘出血点。静脉轻度肿胀，说明视盘受到挤压。见图2。
可能的神经形态描述：广泛性或局灶性筛板神经纤维束缺失，以及细胞性炎症（炎性细胞浸润？Cellular inflammation）
之前发现的血管内皮素-1持续微量泵入，造的是AAION的模。[34]用兔子。
AAION的病变：ON血流量减少，早期RGC、ON轴突和髓鞘丢失。
rNAION描述：眼底照相形态： 视盘水肿，视盘表面的视网膜血管暗淡，视盘边缘模糊，视网膜静脉国度肿胀（图4）。与人类相似。组织学：水肿局限于光照部位：视神经水肿局限于视神经前部和筛板区；进行性水肿造成视神经间隔综合征（？Compartment Syndrome），进一步挤压连累其他视神经毛细血管。
人类NAION：[68, 69]有确诊NAION的报导，有组织学检查。本案中（发作后20天），视神经损伤与间隔综合征中所见相符，血管受压是损伤的主因，与供血区域无关（？without respect for vascular territories），继发的RGC死亡以凋亡的方式呈现[69, 70]。OCT发现有与视野缺损相符的视网膜神经纤维和RGC丢失[21]，死亡前21.5年确诊NAION，发现有严重轴突缺失，持续性细胞炎症，近期受累的神经更严重。
[37]视网膜平铺免疫染c-Fos见RGC局灶性表达增多，未影响区相对较少。神网膜神经节细胞特异性转录因子如Brn3在造模后18h就下降了。
大鼠模型（轴突切除）TUNEL染色显示RGC确实是凋亡死的，高峰在第10.5天[72]。
造模时缺血严重程度与激光能量、曝光时间在一定范围内成正比，太强的刺激可能造成视网膜梗塞，所以每个实验前都要进行激光最佳刺激量的探索。而且各种动物都表现出了个体差异，所以有必要进行基线评价。
所有AION的模型都是以视神经急性缺血为理论指导，而不是NAION和围术期（peAION）的高血压、高危视盘，以及AAION中的大中动脉炎性反应。},

	abstract = {Patrick Soon-Shiong has only one mode of thinking: big. The South Africa-born surgeon-scientist pioneered islet transplants to treat diabetes and nanoparticle drug delivery for cancer, and he has founded two multi-billion-dollar pharmaceutical firms—Abraxis BioScience, now part of Celgene Corporation headquartered in New Jersey, and American Pharmaceutical Partners, acquired by the German company Fresenius Kabi. He's now setting his sights on transforming the entire US biomedical system from bench to bedside, starting with a modern, high-speed data network. Together with his wife, Michele Chan, the Los Angeles–based entrepeneur founded the Chan Soon-Shiong (CSS) Institute for Advanced Health in early 2011. The project has already spent a quarter of a billion dollars, much of it Soon-Shiong's.
With locations thus far at the Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California and the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, the CSS Institute aims to network everyone with a stake in health care—from bench researchers to clinicians and patients to insurers—so that they can collaborate using easily-shared health records, medical images, genomes and any other kind of data. The Institute is in the midst of launching its first major project, the Cancer Knowledge Alliance Network. But that's just the beginning. Amber Dance sat down with Soon-Shiong to talk about how uniting physicians and scientists will surmount the most pressing challenges in biomedicine and cancer research.},

Their study, which was widely misinterpreted as saying that most cancers are due neither to genetic inheritance nor environmental factors but simply bad luck, sparked controversy. To date, a few hundred papers have been written in response, including (2–6), with some [e.g., (2)] coming to opposite conclusions. What is this controversy about? Tomasetti and Vogelstein concluded that 65\% of the differences in the risk of certain cancers is linked to stem cell divisions in the various cancerous tissues examined (1). On page 1330 of this issue, Tomasetti et al. (7) provide further evidence that this is not specific to the United States.

For acute ischaemic stroke, the addition of endovascular thrombectomy of proximal large artery occlusion to intravenous alteplase increases functional independence for a further fifth of patients. The benefits of aspirin in preventing early recurrent ischaemic stroke are greater than previously recognised. Other strategies to prevent recurrent stroke now include direct oral anticoagulants as an alternative to warfarin for atrial fibrillation, and carotid stenting as an alternative to endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis. For acute intracerebral haemorrhage, trials are ongoing to assess the effectiveness of acute blood pressure lowering, haemostatic therapy, minimally invasive surgery, anti-inflammation therapy, and neuroprotection methods. Pharmacological and stem-cell therapies promise to facilitate brain regeneration, rehabilitation, and functional recovery. Despite declining stroke mortality rates, the global burden of stroke is increasing. A more comprehensive approach to primary prevention of stroke is required that targets people at all levels of risk and is integrated with prevention strategies for other diseases that share common risk factors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The accumulation of altered proteins and damaged mitochondria, particularly at axon terminals, ultimately might overwhelm the capacity of intracellular disposal mechanisms.

	doi = {10.1186/s12874-016-0116-4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scoping reviews are used to identify knowledge gaps, set research agendas, and identify implications for decision-making. The conduct and reporting of scoping reviews is inconsistent in the literature. We conducted a scoping review to identify: papers that utilized and/or described scoping review methods; guidelines for reporting scoping reviews; and studies that assessed the quality of reporting of scoping reviews.
METHODS: We searched nine electronic databases for published and unpublished literature scoping review papers, scoping review methodology, and reporting guidance for scoping reviews. Two independent reviewers screened citations for inclusion. Data abstraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. Quantitative (e.g. frequencies of methods) and qualitative (i.e. content analysis of the methods) syntheses were conducted.
RESULTS: After searching 1525 citations and 874 full-text papers, 516 articles were included, of which 494 were scoping reviews. The 494 scoping reviews were disseminated between 1999 and 2014, with 45\% published after 2012. Most of the scoping reviews were conducted in North America (53\%) or Europe (38\%), and reported a public source of funding (64\%). The number of studies included in the scoping reviews ranged from 1 to 2600 (mean of 118). Using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology guidance for scoping reviews, only 13\% of the scoping reviews reported the use of a protocol, 36\% used two reviewers for selecting citations for inclusion, 29\% used two reviewers for full-text screening, 30\% used two reviewers for data charting, and 43\% used a pre-defined charting form. In most cases, the results of the scoping review were used to identify evidence gaps (85\%), provide recommendations for future research (84\%), or identify strengths and limitations (69\%). We did not identify any guidelines for reporting scoping reviews or studies that assessed the quality of scoping review reporting.
CONCLUSION: The number of scoping reviews conducted per year has steadily increased since 2012. Scoping reviews are used to inform research agendas and identify implications for policy or practice. As such, improvements in reporting and conduct are imperative. Further research on scoping review methodology is warranted, and in particular, there is need for a guideline to standardize reporting.},

In this population we assessed all-cause mortality and incidence of strokes, re-intervention, and aortic valve regurgitation at 1 year after implantation. Then we compared 1 year outcomes in this population with those for intermediate-risk patients treated with surgical valve replacement in the PARTNER 2A trial between Dec 23, 2011, and Nov 6, 2013, using a prespecified propensity score analysis to account for between-trial differences in baseline characteristics. The clinical events committee and echocardiographic core laboratory methods were the same for both studies. The primary endpoint was the composite of death from any cause, all strokes, and incidence of moderate or severe aortic regurgitation.

In the propensity-score analysis we included 963 patients treated with SAPIEN 3 TAVR and 747 with surgical valve replacement.

前瞻性研究与回顾性研究的区别，就数据获得时间而言，是开始研究时数据是否已存在——前瞻的，数据还没有；回顾的，数据已存在。就因果关系而言，是因果先后顺序能否确定——前瞻性研究可以明确因在前果在后，回顾性研究不能明确。就研究操作而言，是对数据的获取否能进行控制——前瞻的，可以有统一的诊断标准、检测标准、评判标准；回顾的，这些都不可控。同一研究目的，既可以做回顾性研究，也可以做前瞻性研究，不冲突。如果一个课题是从现在开始收集病人，然后等所有的数据全部收集完再做统一分析，这种研究是前瞻性研究。
 
 

请问一下，我的数据分两大组，一组数据是回顾性的，另一组数据是前瞻性的，这样的怎么分析？谢谢！

战友的信息量太少。战友说有两组数据，不知道是不是关于同一问题的。如果不是，各做各的。如果是，也不建议混合起来分析，因为回顾和前瞻中数据获取标准一般都是难以统一的，各分析各的就好，然后统一讨论。回顾性研究，可以做病例对照研究、横断面研究等，前瞻性研究，可以做队列研究、非随机同期对照研究，战友可以根据研究条件选择研究设计，然后用相应的分析方法即可。
 
请问回顾性研究里面选取实验对象是不是不能随机选取？如果是，选取是什么方式呢？
——
个人愚见，供参考：
随机选取的目的在于选出与总体相近的样本。
回顾性研究的样本状况一般难以确定，因此通常是全选，使样本尽量多，以尽量接近总体的情况。
当然，如果样本量过多（比如几万），那也可以考虑随机选取。方法就是随机抽样的方法
 
个人认为回顾性队列研究因果关系也是明确的，回顾性是结果已经出现，你回顾性收集过往的信息，前瞻是结果还没出现，你需要定期随访，才能得到结果。回顾性研究省时省力，前瞻性费时费力。补充我前面那句话，回顾性队列研究需要得到准确的资料才能明确因果关系

	abstract = {Abstract Propensity score matching (PSM) has become a popular approach to estimate causal treatment effects. It is widely applied when evaluating labour market policies, but empirical examples can be found in very diverse fields of study. Once the researcher has decided to use PSM, he is confronted with a lot of questions regarding its implementation. To begin with, a first decision has to be made concerning the estimation of the propensity score. Following that one has to decide which matching algorithm to choose and determine the region of common support. Subsequently, the matching quality has to be assessed and treatment effects and their standard errors have to be estimated. Furthermore, questions like ‘what to do if there is choice-based sampling?’ or ‘when to measure effects?’ can be important in empirical studies. Finally, one might also want to test the sensitivity of estimated treatment effects with respect to unobserved heterogeneity or failure of the common support condition. Each implementation step involves a lot of decisions and different approaches can be thought of. The aim of this paper is to discuss these implementation issues and give some guidance to researchers who want to use PSM for evaluation purposes.},

We investigated three aspects of cognition vital to many visual artists: creative cognition, perception, and perception-to-action. We found that the art students became more creative via the reorganization of prefrontal white matter but did not find any significant changes in perceptual ability or related neural activity in the art students relative to the control group. Moreover, the art students improved in their ability to sketch human figures from observation, and multivariate patterns of cortical and cerebellar activity evoked by this drawing task became increasingly separable between art and non-art students. Our findings suggest that the emergence of visual artistic skills is supported by plasticity in neural pathways that enable creative cognition and mediate perceptuomotor integration.},

We used a novel external memory aid to promote recall of episodic memories in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. SenseCam, a small wearable camera, recorded significant events in the lives of six Alzheimer's disease patients. Every two days for two weeks each patient's memory for an event was assessed, followed by a structured review of the SenseCam images. Longer-term recall was tested one and three months later. A written diary control condition followed the same procedure. Across 40 events the SenseCam review method resulted in significantly more details of an event being recalled over two weeks than the written diary method in five out of the six patients. At three months post event, four out of five patients (one had dropped out) recalled significantly more details of events in the SenseCam condition while the other patient showed no significant difference. Viewing SenseCam images of personally experienced events may significantly improve autobiographical memory in patients with even moderate Alzheimer's disease.},

Major depression occurs in 2\% of adults aged 55 years or older, and its prevalence rises with increasing age.

In contrast to younger patients, older adults with depression more commonly have several concurrent medical disorders and cognitive impairment. Depression occurring in older patients is often undetected or inadequately treated. Antidepressants are the best-studied treatment option, but psychotherapy, exercise therapy, and electroconvulsive therapy may also be effective. Psychotherapy is recommended for patients with mild to moderate severity depression. Many older patients need the same doses of antidepressant medication that are used for younger adult patients. Although antidepressants may effectively treat depression in older adults, they tend to pose greater risk for adverse events because of multiple medical comorbidities and drug-drug interactions in case of polypharmacy. High-quality evidence does not support the use of pharmacologic treatment of depression in patients with dementia. Polypharmacy in older patients can be minimized by using the Screening Tool of Older Persons Prescriptions and Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment (STOPP/START) criteria, a valid and reliable screening tool that enables physicians to avoid potentially inappropriate medications, undertreatment, or errors of omissions in older people. Antidepressants can be gradually tapered over a period of several weeks, but discontinuation of antidepressants may be associated with relapse or recurrence of depression, so the patient should be closely observed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions and Relevance{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Major depression in older adults is common and can be effectively treated with antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy.

Although overall still a rare disease, adolescent type 2 diabetes now poses major challenges to paediatric and adult diabetes services in many countries. Therapeutic options are heavily curtailed by a dearth of knowledge about the condition, with low numbers of participants and poor trial recruitment impeding research. Together with lifestyle modification, metformin remains the first-line therapy for adolescents with type 2 diabetes, although the majority rapidly progress to treatment failure and insulin therapy. Early bariatric surgery is controversial but has great potential to transform outcomes. Health systems must respond by both concentrating patients in specialist clinical services integrated with translational research programmes, but also by joining up with local health and social care services to improve engagement and uptake of services.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The primary outcome was weight at 1 year of follow-up, analysed with mixed-effects models according to intention-to-treat principles and adjusted for centre and baseline weight. In a hierarchical closed-testing procedure, we compared combined behavioural programme arms with brief intervention, then compared the 12-week programme and 52-week programme. We did a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis using person-level data and modelled outcomes over a 25-year time horizon using microsimulation. This study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN82857232.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Between Oct 18, 2012, and Feb 10, 2014, we enrolled 1269 participants. 1267 eligible participants were randomly assigned to the brief intervention (n=211), the 12-week programme (n=528), and the 52-week programme (n=528). Two participants in the 12-week programme had been found to be ineligible shortly after randomisation and were excluded from the analysis. 823 (65\%) of 1267 participants completed an assessment at 1 year and 856 (68\%) participants at 2 years. All eligible participants were included in the analyses. At 1 year, mean weight changes in the groups were −3·26 kg (brief intervention), −4·75 kg (12-week programme), and −6·76 kg (52-week programme). Participants in the behavioural programme lost more weight than those in the brief intervention (adjusted difference −2·71 kg, 95\% CI −3·86 to −1·55; p{\textless}0·0001). The 52-week programme was more effective than the 12-week programme (−2·14 kg, −3·05 to −1·22; p{\textless}0·0001). Differences between groups were still significant at 2 years. No adverse events related to the intervention were reported. Over 2 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; compared with brief intervention) was £159 per kg lost for the 52-week programme and £91 per kg for the 12-week programme. Modelled over 25 years after baseline, the ICER for the 12-week programme was dominant compared with the brief intervention. The ICER for the 52-week programme was cost-effective compared with the brief intervention (£2394 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) and the 12-week programme (£3804 per QALY).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}For adults with overweight or obesity, referral to this open-group behavioural weight-loss programme for at least 12 weeks is more effective than brief advice and self-help materials.

	abstract = {A 40 year old man was referred to the cardiology team because of bradycardia. He was an inpatient undergoing treatment for an infection of unknown origin and he had developed acute-on-chronic kidney dysfunction. His medical history included type 1 diabetes, a previous renal transplant for diabetic nephropathy, and permanent atrial fibrillation.

The patient was asymptomatic, with a blood pressure of 122/74 mm Hg and a pulse oximetry reading of 97\% on room air (normal value ≥94\%) His electrocardiogram (ECG) at the time of referral is shown in figure 1⇓.



Fig 1  12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at the time of referral



1.  What is the underlying rhythm on the ECG?

2.  What are the potential causes of bradycardia in this patient?

3.  How should the patient be managed and what is the definitive treatment?

\#\#\# 1. What is the underlying rhythm on the ECG?

\#\#\#\# Short answer

The atrial rhythm is atrial fibrillation. However, the ventricular rate is slow (36 beats/min) and regular with broad QRS complexes. The patient has developed atrial fibrillation with complete heart block.

\#\#\#\# Discussion

The ECG has no discernible p waves, but there are fibrillatory waves seen in some leads. The appearance of the atrial activity in lead V1 can sometimes be confused with atrial flutter or a focal atrial tachycardia. This phenomenon occurs because the right atrial appendage lies between the V1 electrode and the left atrium and effectively “filters” the waves so that they appear organised. However, there is no organised atrial activity in the other leads and closer inspection of the fibrillatory waves in lead V1 shows an irregular and rapid rate, …},

Detailed descriptions of randomisation and intervention have already been reported. We analysed the associations between mean blood pressure achieved on treatment; prerandomisation baseline blood pressure; or time-updated blood pressure (last on treatment value before an event) on the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospital admission for heart failure; the components of the composite outcome; and all-cause death.

TRANSCEND took place between Nov 1, 2001, and May 30, 2004. 30 937 patients were recruited from 733 centres in 40 countries and followed up for a median of 56 months. In ONTARGET, 25 127 patients known to be tolerant to angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors were randomly assigned after a run-in period to oral ramipril 10 mg/day (n=8407), telmisartan 80 mg/day (n=8386), or the combination of both (n=8334). In TRANSCEND, 5810 patients who were intolerant to ACE-inhibitors were randomly assigned to oral telmisartan 80 mg/day (n=2903) or placebo (n=2907). Baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 mm Hg or higher was associated with greater incidence of all outcomes compared with 120 mm Hg to less than 140 mm Hg. By contrast, a baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) less than 70 mm Hg was associated with the highest risk for most outcomes compared with all DBP categories 70 mm Hg or more. In 4052 patients with SBP less than 120 mm Hg on treatment, the risk of the composite cardiovascular outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1·14, 95\% CI 1·03–1·26), cardiovascular death (1·29, 1·12–1·49), and all deaths (1·28, 1·15–1·42) were increased compared with those in whom SBP was 120–140 mm Hg during treatment (HR 1 for all outcomes, n=16099). No harm or benefit was observed for myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospital admission for heart failure. Mean achieved SBP more accurately predicted outcomes than baseline or time-updated SBP, and was associated with the lowest risk at approximately 130 mm Hg, and at 110–120 mm Hg risk increased for the combined outcome, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death except stroke. A mean DBP less than 70 mm Hg (n=5352) during treatment was associated with greater risk of the composite primary outcome (HR 1·31, 95\% CI 1·20–1·42), myocardial infarction (1·55, 1·33–1·80), hospital admission for heart failure (1·59, 1·36–1·86) and all-cause death (1·16, 1·06–1·28) than a DBP 70–80 mm Hg (14 305).

	abstract = {James Parkinson's Essay on the Shaking Palsy published in 1817 provided the first clear clinical description for the disorder now known throughout the world by his name. His primary reason for publishing his monograph shortly before his retirement from medical practice was to draw the medical profession's attention to a malady, which had not yet been defined as a nosological entity. He also hoped that the eminent anatomists of the day would be stimulated to elucidate the pathological lesion responsible for the clinical picture and that this in turn might lead to a rational cure. The concept of Parkinson's disease remains clinically based and successive generations of neurologists have refined and embellished Parkinson's seminal descriptions. Narrative accounts by affected individuals have also helped physicians understand what it is like to live with Parkinson's disease. For many years, the pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease were disputed and there were few clinico-pathological reports with adequate clinical description. However, most neurologists now link severe loss of nigral cells in the ventrolateral tier of the pars compacta of the substantia nigra with bradykinesia and the presence of Lewy bodies in a number of discrete brain stem and cortical regions with Parkinson's disease. There are many unanswered clinical questions relating to Parkinson's disease including the striking heterogeneity and frequent limb asymmetry. It also remains somewhat uncertain whether Parkinson's disease is ever truly unilateral by the time of clinical presentation and whether the hand rather than the foot is the most common site of onset. Hyposmia and visual hallucinations are helpful pointers in distinguishing Parkinson's disease from atypical Parkinsonism and should be specifically enquired about in the history. Simple reliable cultural-specific smell identification batteries are an urgent need and target of clinical research. It remains to be determined whether Alzheimer type dementia as opposed to a dysexecutive syndrome should be considered a part of Parkinson's disease and further detailed clinico-pathological correlative studies are needed. It is also unclear whether autosomal dominant monogenetic Parkinsonism due to synuclein or LRRK-2 mutations will prove to be identical clinically with Parkinson's disease and for the present it is wiser to regard Parkinson's disease as a sporadic disorder. Parkinson was an active political reformer and if alive today would certainly be campaigning to translate more effectively the rich seam of neuroscientific research of the last decade into therapeutic benefits for the rising number of people who are developing the shaking palsy as a result of increasing longevity in the developed world. © 2007 Movement Disorder Society},

As the first implementation of a parallel web crawler in the R environment, RCrawler can crawl, parse, store pages, extract contents, and produce data that can be directly employed for web content mining applications. However, it is also flexible, and could be adapted to other applications. The main features of RCrawler are multi-threaded crawling, content extraction, and duplicate content detection. In addition, it includes functionalities such as URL and content-type filtering, depth level controlling, and a robot.txt parser. Our crawler has a highly optimized system, and can download a large number of pages per second while being robust against certain crashes and spider traps. In this paper, we describe the design and functionality of RCrawler, and report on our experience of implementing it in an R environment, including different optimizations that handle the limitations of R. Finally, we discuss our experimental results.},

	abstract = {Cancer-predisposing genes associated with inherited cancer syndromes help explain mechanisms of sporadic carcinogenesis and often inform normal development. Cowden syndrome (CS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by high lifetime risks of epithelial cancers, such that ∼50\% of affected individuals are wild-type for known cancer-predisposing genes. Using whole-exome and Sanger sequencing of a multi-generation CS family affected by thyroid and other cancers, we identified a pathogenic missense heterozygous SEC23B variant (c.1781T{\textgreater}G [p.Val594Gly]) that segregates with the phenotype. We also found germline heterozygous SEC23B variants in 3/96 (3\%) unrelated mutation-negative CS probands with thyroid cancer and in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), representing apparently sporadic cancers. We note that the TCGA thyroid cancer dataset is enriched with unique germline deleterious SEC23B variants associated with a significantly younger age of onset. SEC23B encodes Sec23 homolog B (S. cerevisiae), a component of coat protein complex II (COPII), which transports proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. Interestingly, germline homozygous or compound-heterozygous SEC23B mutations cause an unrelated disorder, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II, and SEC23B-deficient mice suffer from secretory organ degeneration due to ER-stress-associated apoptosis. By characterizing the p.Val594Gly variant in a normal thyroid cell line, we show that it is a functional alteration that results in ER-stress-mediated cell-colony formation and survival, growth, and invasion, which reflect aspects of a cancer phenotype. Our findings suggest a different role for SEC23B, whereby germline heterozygous variants associate with cancer predisposition potentially mediated by ER stress "addiction."},

Additionally, the heatmaps can be recolored, rescaled or rotated in a customized manner. In addition, HemI provides multiple clustering strategies for analyzing the data. Publication-quality figures can be exported directly. We propose that HemI can be a useful toolkit for conveniently visualizing and manipulating heatmaps.

	abstract = {Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a pleiotropic protein implicated in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome, aging, cancer, coronary heart diseases, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, and sepsis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of NAMPT in these physiological and pathological processes are not fully understood. Here, we provide experimental evidence that a Nampt gene homozygous knockout (Nampt−/−) resulted in lethality at an early stage of mouse embryonic development and death within 5–10 days in adult mice accompanied by a 25.24±2.22\% body weight loss, after the tamoxifen induction of NamptF/F × Cre mice. These results substantiate that Nampt is an essential gene for life. In Nampt−/− mice versus Nampt+/+ mice, biochemical assays indicated that liver and intestinal tissue NAD levels were decreased significantly; histological examination showed that mouse intestinal villi were atrophic and disrupted, and visceral fat was depleted; mass spectrometry detected unusual higher serum polyunsaturated fatty acid containing triglycerides. RNA-seq analyses of both mouse and human pediatric liver transcriptomes have convergently revealed that NAMPT is involved in key basic cellular functions such as transcription, translation, cell signaling, and fundamental metabolism. Notably, the expression of all eight enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle were decreased significantly in the Nampt−/− mice. These findings prompt us to posit that adult Nampt−/− mouse lethality is a result of a short supply of ATP from compromised intestinal absorption of nutrients from digested food, which leads to the exhaustion of body fat stores.},

	abstract = {Abiraterone blocks androgen synthesis and prolongs survival in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, which is otherwise driven by intratumoral androgen synthesis. Abiraterone is metabolized in patients to Δ4-abiraterone (D4A), which has even greater anti-tumour activity and is structurally similar to endogenous steroidal 5α-reductase substrates, such as testosterone. Here, we show that D4A is converted to at least three 5α-reduced and three 5β-reduced metabolites in human serum. The initial 5α-reduced metabolite, 3-keto-5α-abiraterone, is present at higher concentrations than D4A in patients with prostate cancer taking abiraterone, and is an androgen receptor agonist, which promotes prostate cancer progression. In a clinical trial of abiraterone alone, followed by abiraterone plus dutasteride (a 5α-reductase inhibitor), 3-keto-5α-abiraterone and downstream metabolites were depleted by the addition of dutasteride, while D4A concentrations rose, showing that dutasteride effectively blocks production of a tumour-promoting metabolite and permits D4A accumulation. Furthermore, dutasteride did not deplete the three 5β-reduced metabolites, which were also clinically detectable, demonstrating the specific biochemical effects of pharmacological 5α-reductase inhibition on abiraterone metabolism. Our findings suggest a previously unappreciated and biochemically specific method of clinically fine-tuning abiraterone metabolism to optimize therapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heatmaps are an indispensible visualization tool for examining large-scale snapshots of genomic activity across various types of next-generation sequencing datasets. However, traditional heatmap software do not typically offer multi-scale insight across multiple layers of genomic analysis (e.g., differential expression analysis, principal component analysis, gene ontology analysis, and network analysis) or multiple types of next-generation sequencing datasets (e.g., ChIP-seq and RNA-seq). As such, it is natural to want to interact with a heatmap's contents using an extensive set of integrated analysis tools applicable to a broad array of genomic data types.
RESULTS: We propose a user-friendly ChIP-seq and RNA-seq software suite for the interactive visualization and analysis of genomic data, including integrated features to support differential expression analysis, interactive heatmap production, principal component analysis, gene ontology analysis, and dynamic network analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: MicroScope is hosted online as an R Shiny web application based on the D3 JavaScript library: http://microscopebioinformatics.org/ . The methods are implemented in R, and are available as part of the MicroScope project at: https://github.com/Bohdan-Khomtchouk/Microscope .},

	doi = {10.1186/s12859-016-1442-6},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cluster heatmaps are commonly used in biology and related fields to reveal hierarchical clusters in data matrices. This visualization technique has high data density and reveal clusters better than unordered heatmaps alone. However, cluster heatmaps have known issues making them both time consuming to use and prone to error. We hypothesize that visualization techniques without the rigid grid constraint of cluster heatmaps will perform better at clustering-related tasks.
RESULTS: We developed an approach to "unbox" the heatmap values and embed them directly in the hierarchical clustering results, allowing us to use standard hierarchical visualization techniques as alternatives to cluster heatmaps. We then tested our hypothesis by conducting a survey of 45 practitioners to determine how cluster heatmaps are used, prototyping alternatives to cluster heatmaps using pair analytics with a computational biologist, and evaluating those alternatives with hour-long interviews of 5 practitioners and an Amazon Mechanical Turk user study with approximately 200 participants. We found statistically significant performance differences for most clustering-related tasks, and in the number of perceived visual clusters. Visit git.io/vw0t3 for our results.
CONCLUSIONS: The optimal technique varied by task. However, gapmaps were preferred by the interviewed practitioners and outperformed or performed as well as cluster heatmaps for clustering-related tasks. Gapmaps are similar to cluster heatmaps, but relax the heatmap grid constraints by introducing gaps between rows and/or columns that are not closely clustered. Based on these results, we recommend users adopt gapmaps as an alternative to cluster heatmaps.},

	abstract = {In contrast to past centuries, scientific researchers have been currently conducted systematically in all countries as part of an education strategy. As a consequence, scientists have published thousands of reports. Writing an effective article is generally a significant problem for researchers. All parts of an article, specifically the abstract, material and methods, results, discussion and references sections should contain certain features that should always be considered before sending a manuscript to a journal for publication. It is generally known that the material and methods section is a relatively easy section of an article to write. Therefore, it is often a good idea to begin by writing the materials and methods section, which is also a crucial part of an article. Because “reproducible results” are very important in science, a detailed account of the study should be given in this section. If the authors provide sufficient detail, other scientists can repeat their experiments to verify their findings. It is generally recommended that the materials and methods should be written in the past tense, either in active or passive voice. In this section, ethical approval, study dates, number of subjects, groups, evaluation criteria, exclusion criteria and statistical methods should be described sequentially. It should be noted that a well-written materials and methods section markedly enhances the chances of an article being published.},

	doi = {10.18632/oncotarget.16417},
	abstract = {Gastric carcinoma (GC) is a leading cause of mortality. 10\% of GC cases are related with EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) infection. The detailed mechanistic roles EBV genes play and especially the interaction between the viral genes and human genes in GC remain unclear. In this study, raw fastq data from 285 GC samples were downloaded from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), including 25 EBV positive (EBV+) GC samples and 260 EBV negative (EBV-) GC samples. RNA-seq based expression data were generated for both human genes (among all the samples) and for the EBV genes (among the 25 EBV+ samples). Bioinformatics analyses were performed to identify differentially expressed (DEx) human genes and DEx KEGG pathways in EBV+ vs. EBV- samples and co-expressed human gene modules and hub genes among the DEx genes. Within the EBV+ samples, analyses were conducted to find correlation between EBV gene expression and the human gene expression modules, between EBV gene expression and the human hub genes, and between EBV gene expression and the DEx human pathways. EBV genes LMP-1, BALF1 and BALF2 were found to have significant correlation with human hub genes, CNTD2 and VANGL2. EBV genes BALF4 and BALF5 were found to correlate with human pathways, including Jak-STAT signaling and Phosphatidylinositol Signaling System. Our study has revealed the coordinated expression patterns between EBV and human GC transcriptome and identified several key EBV genes that may play an important role in EBV+ GC pathogenesis through their interactions with human genes and pathways.},

	issn = {2374-2445},
	doi = {10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.1609},
	abstract = {Importance: The prevalence of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is expected to increase with recent implementation of annual screening programs. Reliable prognostic biomarkers are needed to identify patients at a high risk for recurrence to guide adjuvant therapy.
Objective: To develop a robust, individualized immune signature that can estimate prognosis in patients with early-stage nonsquamous NSCLC.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective study analyzed the gene expression profiles of frozen tumor tissue samples from 19 public NSCLC cohorts, including 18 microarray data sets and 1 RNA-Seq data set for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma cohort. Only patients with nonsquamous NSCLC with clinical annotation were included. Samples were from 2414 patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, divided into a meta-training cohort (729 patients), meta-testing cohort (716 patients), and 3 independent validation cohorts (439, 323, and 207 patients). All patients underwent surgery with a negative surgical margin, received no adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, and had publicly available gene expression data and survival information. Data were collected from July 22 through September 8, 2016.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival.
Results: Of 2414 patients (1205 men [50\%], 1111 women [46\%], and 98 of unknown sex [4\%]; median age [range], 64 [15-90] years), a prognostic immune signature of 25 gene pairs consisting of 40 unique genes was constructed using the meta-training data set. In the meta-testing and validation cohorts, the immune signature significantly stratified patients into high- vs low-risk groups in terms of overall survival across and within subpopulations with stage I, IA, IB, or II disease and remained as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio range, 1.72 [95\% CI, 1.26-2.33; P {\textless} .001] to 2.36 [95\% CI, 1.47-3.79; P {\textless} .001]) after adjusting for clinical and pathologic factors. Several biological processes, including chemotaxis, were enriched among genes in the immune signature. The percentage of neutrophil infiltration (5.6\% vs 1.8\%) and necrosis (4.6\% vs 1.5\%) was significantly higher in the high-risk immune group compared with the low-risk groups in TCGA data set (P {\textless} .003). The immune signature achieved a higher accuracy (mean concordance index [C-index], 0.64) than 2 commercialized multigene signatures (mean C-index, 0.53 and 0.61) for estimation of survival in comparable validation cohorts. When integrated with clinical characteristics such as age and stage, the composite clinical and immune signature showed improved prognostic accuracy in all validation data sets relative to molecular signatures alone (mean C-index, 0.70 vs 0.63) and another commercialized clinical-molecular signature (mean C-index, 0.68 vs 0.65).
Conclusions and Relevance: The proposed clinical-immune signature is a promising biomarker for estimating overall survival in nonsquamous NSCLC, including early-stage disease. Prospective studies are needed to test the clinical utility of the biomarker in individualized management of nonsquamous NSCLC.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows whole transcriptome profiling of thousands of individual cells, enabling the molecular exploration of tissues at the cellular level. Such analytical capacity is of great interest to many research groups in the world, yet these groups often lack the expertise to handle complex scRNA-seq data sets.
Results: We developed a fully integrated, web-based platform aimed at the complete analysis of scRNA-seq data post genome alignment: from the parsing, filtering, and normalization of the input count data files, to the visual representation of the data, identification of cell clusters, differentially expressed genes (including cluster-specific marker genes), and functional gene set enrichment. This Automated Single-cell Analysis Pipeline (ASAP) combines a wide range of commonly used algorithms with sophisticated visualization tools. Compared with existing scRNA-seq analysis platforms, researchers (including those lacking computational expertise) are able to interact with the data in a straightforward fashion and in real time. Furthermore, given the overlap between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq analysis workflows, ASAP should conceptually be broadly applicable to any RNA-seq dataset. As a validation, we demonstrate how we can use ASAP to simply reproduce the results from a single-cell study of 91 mouse cells involving five distinct cell types.

Individual differences in the propensity for social learning are therefore likely to have important fitness consequences. We asked whether personality might underpin such individual variation in a wild population of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus). We used two field experiments in which individuals had the opportunity to learn how to solve a task from an experienced conspecific demonstrator: exploitation of a novel food and a hidden item of known food. We investigated whether the (1) time spent watching a demonstrator and (2) changes in task-solving behaviour after watching a demonstrator were related to personality. We found that both boldness and anxiety influenced individual performance in social learning. Specifically, bolder and more anxious animals were more likely to show a greater improvement in task solving after watching a demonstrator. In addition, there was also evidence that the acquisition of social information was not always correlated with its use. These findings present new insights into the costs and benefits of different personality types, and have important implications for the evolution of social learning.},

Skeletal remains of an adult and two juveniles of Oryctodromeus cubicularis gen. et sp. nov., a new species of hypsilophodont-grade dinosaur, were found in the expanded distal chamber of a sediment-filled burrow. Correspondence between burrow and adult dimensions supports Oryctodromeus as the burrow maker. Additionally, Oryctodromeus exhibits features of the snout, shoulder girdle and pelvis consistent with digging habits while retaining cursorial hindlimb proportions. Association of adult and young within a terminal chamber provides definitive evidence of extensive parental care in the Dinosauria. As with modern vertebrate cursors that dig, burrowing in Oryctodromeus may have been an important adaptation for the rearing of young. Burrowing also represents a mechanism by which small dinosaurs may have exploited the extreme environments of polar latitudes, deserts and high mountain areas. The ability among dinosaurs to find or make shelter may contradict some scenarios of the Cretaceous–Paleogene impact event. Burrowing habits expand the known range of nonavian dinosaur behaviours and suggest that the cursorial ancestry of dinosaurs did not fully preclude the evolution of different functional regimes, such as fossoriality.},

	abstract = {Using a database of roughly 300 basin-wide conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) stations per year from 1997 to 2003, we examined interannual and seasonal variability of nutrients and chlorophyll across the equatorial Pacific. During this period, chlorophyll concentrations exceeded the range of previous measurements for this region. Nitrate, silicic acid, and phosphate also varied widely but not necessarily coherently with each other or with chlorophyll. Across the La Niña to El Niño continuum there was nonmonotonic variability in chlorophyll, particulate backscatter (a proxy for phytoplankton carbon), and large size fraction (diatom) chlorophyll. In general, while El Niño was associated with decreased phytoplankton biomass, there was no corresponding increase in phytoplankton or diatoms during La Niña. However, there were increases in macronutrients in response to La Niña. We suggest that the lack of a biological response to these nutrient increases is due to their decoupling from iron supply. Multiple linear regression analysis of the physical factors responsible for vertical nutrient fluxes emphasized the importance of winds in the central and western Pacific, and thermocline depth in the east. We suggest that the role of the winds is not limited to enhancement of upwelling, but perhaps more importantly to increased vertical mixing of nutrients. Seasonal patterns were weak but consistent with previous work which has suggested that enhanced productivity in the second half of the calendar year causes reduced surface pCO2. Enhanced coverage of nutrient sensors on the tropical atmosphere ocean (TAO) array would help to quantify seasonal signals associated with processes such as tropical instability waves and lead to a better understanding of the links between productivity, carbon export, and air-sea CO2 exchange.},

Measurements on erythrocytes of four species of bats were also included in the study. Erythrocyte size was significantly positively correlated with genome size at each of the specific, generic, familial, and ordinal levels, with the relationship becoming much stronger following the exclusion of the order Artiodactyla, a group unique among mammals in terms of red blood cell morphology. Physiologically, these results are relevant in light of the known relationship between C-value and mass-corrected metabolic rate in homeotherms. In evolutionary terms, they provide insights into the constraints on genome expansion among mammals and are therefore of interest in attempts to solve the long-standing C-value enigma (also known as the C-value paradox).},

We further propose a hypothesis for the involvement of the SCP in the emergence of consciousness, and review existing data that lend support to our proposal. This hypothesis, unlike several previous theories of consciousness, is firmly rooted in physiology and as such is entirely amenable to empirical testing.},

In particular, the propensity score is a balancing score: conditional on the propensity score, the distribution of observed baseline covariates will be similar between treated and untreated subjects. I describe 4 different propensity score methods: matching on the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score. I describe balance diagnostics for examining whether the propensity score model has been adequately specified. Furthermore, I discuss differences between regression-based methods and propensity score-based methods for the analysis of observational data.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicates that herpes zoster (HZ) may increase the risk of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) or myocardial infarction (MI), but the results are inconsistent. We aim to explore the relationship between HZ and risk of stroke/TIA or MI and between herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) and stroke.
METHODS: We estimated the relative risk (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) with the meta-analysis. Cochran's Q test and Higgins I(2) statistic were used to check for heterogeneity.
RESULTS: HZ infection was significantly associated with increased risk of stroke/TIA (RR = 1.30, 95\% CI: 1.17-1.46) or MI (RR = 1.18, 95\% CI: 1.07-1.30). The risk of stroke after HZO was 1.91 (95\% CI 1.32-2.76), higher than that after HZ. Subgroup analyses revealed increased risk of ischemic stroke after HZ infection but not hemorrhagic stroke. The risk of stroke was increased more at 1 month after HZ infection than at 1-3 months, with a gradual reduced risk with time. The risk of stroke after HZ infection was greater with age less than 40 years than 40-59 years and more than 60 years. Risk of stroke with HZ infection was greater without treatment than with treatment and was greater in Asia than Europe and America but did not differ by sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that HZ infection was associated with increased risk of stroke/TIA or MI, and HZO infection was the most marked risk factor for stroke. Further studies are needed to explore whether zoster vaccination could reduce the risk of stoke/TIA or MI.},

The study was based on a prospective dynamic cohort consisting of 1 million Koreans representing all age groups, genders and geographical areas in the Korea Health Insurance Database. New events of stroke/TIA and HZ were identified using the diagnostic codes in the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision. The risk for stroke/TIA after HZ was compared with HZ-free stroke/TIA individuals according to age group. A total of 766 179 adults were followed up for 11 years from 2003. The incidence of the first-diagnosed HZ cases was 9.40 per 1000 person-years, and that of the first-diagnosed stroke/TIA cases was 9.77 per 1000 person-years. The risk for stroke/TIA was higher in patients who had previous HZ episodes than in those who had never experienced HZ (incidence rate ratio 1.90; 95\% CI 1.85-1.95). In addition, this risk persisted for several years after HZ. The risk of stroke/TIA after HZ gradually decreased with age; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.04 in 18- to 30-year-olds, HR 1.74 in 30- to 40-year-olds, HR 1.43 in 40- to 50-year-olds, HR 1.23 in 50- to 60-year-olds, HR 1.24 in 60- to 70-year-olds, and HR 1.29 in those {\textgreater}70 years old, after controlling risk factors for stroke/TIA.

	abstract = {第一部分中国汉族人群中ACE2基因多态和冠心病及心肌梗塞的关联研究
越来越多的证据显示ACE2(血管紧张素转换酶2)可能是对心血管具有保护性作用的蛋白;但是相应的人群研究却很少。因此我们进行了一项病例对照研究,考察ACE2基因多态和CHD(冠心病)以及MI(心肌梗塞)的关系。在中国汉族人群中,选取了811名CHD病例(其中508名是MI病例)和905名正常对照,通过PCR-RFLP方法鉴定了三个ACE2基因单核苷酸多态位点(1075A/G、8790A/G和16854G/C)的基因型。这些位点间存在连锁不平衡(r{\textasciitilde}2,0.854～0.973)。由于ACE2基因处在X染色体上,统计分析根据不同的性别进行。在女性中,校正环境变量后发现1075A/G(P=0.026,OR=1.98)和16854G/C(P=0.028,OR=1.97)两个位点在隐形模型下和MI相关联。在男性中有两种常见的单体型——AAG和GGC。不饮酒的男性个体中,和最常见的单体型AAG的携带者相比,在校正环境因素后携带单体型GGC的个体具有1.76倍的CHD患病风险(95\%可信区间是1.15-2.69;P=0.007),以及1.77倍的MI患病风险(95\%可信区间是1.12-2.81,P=0.015)。总之,上述结果表明ACE2基因的常见变异可能影响女性MI的发生,它可能与饮酒存在交互作用影响中国男性CHD和MI的患病风险。
第二部分全基因组关联研究中的通路分析方法
全基因组关联(GWA)分析是复杂疾病遗传学研究的革命性进展。目前的研究一般使用单位点分析方法,报告最显著的关联位点和相关基因。由于检验的位点数目众多,遗传背景噪声过多,单位点分析存在一些局限。Wang等人首次将基因表达分析中的通路研究方法GSEA(Gene set enrichment analysis)应用于全基因组关联分析,作为传统单位点分析的补充。但是他们采用一个基因内所有SNP关联统计量的最大值来衡量基因和疾病的关联程度。这种方法受到了基因内部位点数目和局部连锁不平衡的影响,位点数目较多或LD较弱的基因会得到较大的关联统计量,可能在分析中造成偏倚。若在此基础上综合多个基因的统计量来分析基因集合的显著性,检验统计把握度也会受到影响。我们提出VSEA(Variable set enrichment analysis)方法,采用多种方案更加合理地计算基因和疾病关联的统计量,以改进GSEA方法使之更适合全基因组关联数据分析。各种VSEA算法通过模拟数据进行了检验,并在小型全基因组关联数据(LVH前导性研究)中得到了测试。结果显示,采用校正的基因关联统计量后,使用CHI2和类似算法的VSEA方法与Wang的GSEA相比得到了很大的改进;其他一些算法(如基于主成份分析的算法)也显示出一定的潜力。VSEA方法可以作为全基因组关联数据分析中传统统计分析方法的有效补充,为复杂疾病的GWA数据的解释提供更多的帮助。},

	abstract = {全基因组关联研究(genome-wide association study,GWAS)已经被认为是阐明复杂性状遗传关联机制的强有力工具。截止2014年10月底,全球的研究者们累计发现了与1,251种性状(疾病)相关的19,602个单核苷酸多态性(Single Nucleotide Polymorphism,SNP)位点,而具体到某一类性状,只有少数位点可以通过GWAS研究的多阶段严格验证,而这些位点仅能解释很小一部分的遗传变异。大量的研究表明,仅利用已经验证的关联位点进行遗传风险预测效果并不理想,其中的一个主要原因在于这些研究忽略了大量存在的、未被发掘的低效应位点,因此如何充分利用GWAS研究信息成为预测模型成败的关键。近来,主要有两类策略被提出,表现出较好的预测效果:一类是通过设定宽松的假设检验水准,以便纳入一些潜在的关联位点;另一类是借助于混合效应模型将全基因组所有常见变异位点纳入预测模型。本文针对上述两种策略,提出了s GRS和s GRS-LMM方法,旨在探讨其在复杂性状遗传风险预测中的表现。本研究的目的:一是通过与其它方法进行比较来评价s GRS和s GRS-LMM方法的预测准确度;二是探讨影响预测准确度的因素,用以指导预测研究。本研究利用模拟试验,比较BLUP、AM-BLUP、w GRS、RF、s GRS和s GRS-LMM六种方法在高维复杂结构遗传数据中的遗传预测表现,并将这些方法应用到中国人群非小细胞肺癌GWAS数据的遗传风险预测研究。研究内容包括模拟试验和实例分析两个方面:1.基于1号染色体的模拟数据:采用实例GWAS数据的1号染色体基因分型数据,通过设定不同的样本量、遗传度、风险位点个数以及疾病患病率等参数,模拟产生所需的连续性表型和二分类表型,然后应用六种方法进行预测分析。2.实例分析:利用中国汉族人群非小细胞肺癌GWAS数据,将南京研究数据作为训练集,用于建立六种方法的预测模型,北京研究数据作为测试集,用以评价各方法的预测准确度。研究的主要结果:1.模拟数据结果:在绝大多数参数组合情况下,s GRS和s GRS-LMM的预测准确度均优于其它方法;样本量、遗传度、预设风险位点个数以及疾病患病率均是影响各方法预测准确度的因素;连续性表型和二分类表型的结论基本相似。2.实例分析结果:s GRS和s GRS-LMM的预测准确度均优于其它方法,而且s GRS-LMM预测准确度最高,AUC值达到0.735,但与理论预测准确度相比还有一定差距。结论模拟试验和实例分析均表明sGRS和sGRS-LMM可以用于全基因组数据的遗传风险预测研究,总体表现优于同类方法。},

	abstract = {单核苷酸多态性(SNP)是指由单个脱氧核苷酸变异引起的基因序列的多态性,SNP能够帮助定位与疾病相关联的基因,从而解开复杂疾病的遗传病因。随着高通量基因分型技术的高速发展,SNP的数量大到足以覆盖到整个基因组,在全基因组范围内探测关联SNP位点变得可行。全基因组关联研究(GWAS)就是对全基因组范围内的SNP位点进行研究,以期发现某些与复杂疾病相关联的致病基因。然而由于全基因组关联数据超高维、样本小的特性,使得关联SNP的探测具有很高的挑战性。随机森林(RF)是一种先进的机器学习方法,应用于一些复杂疾病的全基因组关联研究。RF在一些规模不大的数据集中具有较好的预测精度,但是其依然存在着在大型数据集中建立精准预测模型的难题。针对上述难题,本文提出了一个基于随机森林的两步骤SNP子集分类的方法——TSRF(Two Steps SNP subset classification method based on Random Forest),应用于GWAS数据集中建立精准的随机森林模型。第一步,对每个SNP位点计算其重要性分数(IS),然后通过Wilcoxon秩和检测对每个SNP计算一个p-值,再设立一个阈值,将原始数据集中p-值高于该阈值的SNP删除,剩余的SNP被认为是一个相关SNP子集;第二步,利用卡方检测(χ2)对相关SNP子集进行统计显著性计算,根据得到的卡方值的高低,再设定某个阈值,将剩下的相关联SNP进一步分入到两个子集中去:高相关与低相关SNP子集。构建RF里的每颗决策树时,在节点分裂进行特征子集抽样时,就只会按比例抽取这两个子集中的SNP,因而最终的预测结果总是只考虑相关的SNP。TSRF方法有效地对全基因关联数据集进行降维,最终生成更精准的随机森林模型,同时降低了泛化误差,还可以避免过拟合。在帕金森病和老年痴呆症真实数据集上我们对TSRF方法进行测试评估,并且将该方法与传统的RF方法以及近年提出的GRRF和WSRF方法进行比较。测试结果表明,当病例-对照的数据对象远少于SNP数量时,TSRF方法的预测精度更高,同时泛化误差更低,是优于这些方法的。最后,通过TSRF方法识别出帕金森病的病例-对照数据集中比较靠前的潜在的关联SNP,为后续的生物学验证实验提供指导作用。},

	abstract = {随着分子生物学检测技术的不断进步,全基因组关联研究已经成为复杂性疾病遗传致病机制研究最重要的研究手段之一。近年来发表的大量GWAS结果,揭示了与人类各种复杂性疾病或性状相关的大量基因组区域或易感基因,为进一步揭示其发病机制奠定了基础。然而,全基因组关联研究也面临着一系列的挑战,尤其是当前以单个位点分析为主的GWAS统计分析策略存在诸多的局限性。如何充分利用各种与疾病相关的生物学信息,挖掘GWAS高维数据中所蕴藏的信息,探索出一套统计分析策略和方法,已成为完善和发展现有GWAS研究策略的一个统计学难题。 	为此,本研究通过计算机模拟,从统计学性质的角度,系统地评价了利用先验信息的多水平模型在病例对照设计GWAS中的应用效果；并结GWAS实际资料,从实际应用的角度,探讨了多水平模型分析GWAS资料的策略和方法。 	第一部分,基于不同参数的二项分布先验信息以及实际GWAS数据的生物学先验信息设计了2个模拟试验,评价不同先验信息对多水平模型应用效果的影响,主要结论如下： 	(1)在GWAS常采用的1E-5或者1E-7检验水准时,当位点与疾病的关联强度较弱时(OR=1.1),多水平模型的检验效能接近或略高于logistic回归模型,但此时两种方法的效能均较低；随着OR值的不断增加(OR{\textgreater}1.1),多水平模型的检验效能均要高于logistic回归模型。 	(2)从参数估计效果来看,在不同参数组合和先验信息时,多水平模型的参数估计均方误差(MSE)和区间估计宽度(WCI)均要小于logistic回归模型,结果提示纳入先验信息有助于提高参数估计的效果。 	(3)在各种参数组合时,多水平模型ROC曲线下面积均要大于logistic回归模型。该结果表明：一方面,多水平模型对于致病位点有更高的检验效能,另一方面,对于“噪声”位点也具有更好的控制能力。 	第二部分,为考察生物学先验信息的不完整性、先验信息带有额外“噪声”以及无信息先验对于多水平模型在GWAS中应用效果的影响,本研究分别设计了三个模拟试验对生物学先验信息进行了敏感性分析。主要结论如下： 	(1)多水平模型中是否纳入重要的生物学先验信息将会对其应用效果产生重要影响。如果模型中纳入与疾病最为相关和重要的生物学信息,则在其它相关生物学信息缺失或者为无信息的“白噪声”时,多水平模型的效能均高于logistic回归模型,其ROC曲线下面积也会高于logistic回归模型；反之,如果模型中缺失与疾病最为相关和重要的生物学信息,多水平模型的效能将会明显下降,ROC曲线下面积将会低于logistic回归模型。 	(2)在GWAS中,通常认为SNPs的遗传效应并不是非常的强(例如OR值通常为1.1,1.2等)。在这种情况下,无论是否纳入与疾病最为相关和重要的生物学信息,多水平模型的效能与传统的logistic回归模型也相差芜几。仅在SNPs位点的遗传效应较强时(例如OR≥1.3),多水平模型如果缺失重要先验信息,其效能则要低于logistic回归模型。 	(3)在GWAS实际资料分析中,即便构建的先验信息具有一定程度额外“噪声”,多水平模型的效能或者ROC曲线下面积仍要高于或者接近于logistic回归模型。 	(4)在各种敏感性分析中,无论是先验信息的缺失、增加额外的“噪声”,还是仅采用无先验的“噪声”,均对多水平模型参数估计产生不同程度的影响。但是,在不同情况下,多水平模型参数估计误差均方和区间估计宽度均要小于logistic回归模型。 	第三部分,基于非小细胞肺癌GWAS实例分析,系统地探讨了利用先验信息的多水平模型在GWAS中的研究策略和分析方法。 	首先,通过研究实例和基于各种网络生物信息公共数据库,探讨了各种生物学先验信息的利用方法。其次,构建了非小细胞肺癌GWAS实际资料的生物学先验信息矩阵。在该矩阵中,主要利用了各个SNPs位点的遗传保守性得分、基因功能分类以及相近区域内处于强LD SNPs的累计结果。最后,采用利用先验生物学信息的多水平模型进行实例分析。结果表明多水平模型和logistic回归模型在同一染色体区域内均能检测出阳性结果的SNPs位点。多水平模型的点估计略低于logistic回归模型,其区问估计比logistic回归模型更窄。 	总之,本研究通过计算机模拟研究和实例研究,评价整合利用各种生物学先验信息多水平模型的GWAS研究策略,期望能够更好地控制GWAS高维数据分析的假阳性,并且保证一定检验效能,从统计学角度和生物学角度来识别与疾病有关联的遗传变异。 	本研究提出的基于先验信息的多水平模型GWAS研究策略和分析方法,较好地回答了生物学实际工作者的问题,值得推广应用。},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ticagrelor is an effective antiplatelet therapy for patients with coronary atherosclerotic disease and might be more effective than aspirin in preventing recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events in patients with acute cerebral ischaemia of atherosclerotic origin. Our aim was to test for a treatment-by-ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis interaction in a subgroup analysis of patients in the Acute Stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack Treated with Aspirin or Ticagrelor and Patient Outcomes (SOCRATES) trial.
METHODS: SOCRATES was a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial of ticagrelor versus aspirin in patients aged 40 years or older with a non-cardioembolic, non-severe acute ischaemic stroke, or high-risk transient ischaemic attack from 674 hospitals in 33 countries. We randomly allocated patients (1:1) to ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily for days 2-90, given orally) or aspirin (300 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for days 2-90, given orally) within 24 h of symptom onset. Investigators classified all patients into atherosclerotic and non-atherosclerotic groups for the prespecified, exploratory analysis reported in this study. The primary endpoint was the time to occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days. Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat. The SOCRATES trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01994720.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 7, 2014, and Oct 29, 2015, we randomly allocated 13 199 patients (6589 [50\%] to ticagrelor and 6610 [50\%] to aspirin). Potentially symptomatic ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis was reported in 3081 (23\%) of 13 199 patients. We found a treatment-by-atherosclerotic stenosis interaction (p=0·017). 103 (6·7\%) of 1542 patients with ipsilateral stenosis in the ticagrelor group and 147 (9·6\%) of 1539 patients with ipsilateral stenosis in the aspirin group had an occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days (hazard ratio 0·68 [95\% CI 0·53-0·88]; p=0·003). In 10 118 patients with no ipsilateral stenosis, 339 (6·7\%) of 5047 patients in the ticagrelor group had an occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days compared with 350 (6·9\%) of 5071 in the aspirin group (0·97 [0·84-1·13]; p=0·72). There were no significant differences in the proportion of life-threatening bleeding or major or minor bleeding events in patients with ipsilateral stenosis in the ticagrelor group compared with the aspirin group.
INTERPRETATION: In this prespecified exploratory analysis, ticagrelor was superior to aspirin at preventing stroke, myocardial infarction, or death at 90 days in patients with acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack when associated with ipsilateral atherosclerotic stenosis. An understanding of stroke mechanisms and causes is important to deliver safe and efficacious treatments for early stroke prevention.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ticagrelor may be a more effective antiplatelet therapy than aspirin for the prevention of recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events in patients with acute cerebral ischemia.
METHODS: We conducted an international double-blind, controlled trial in 674 centers in 33 countries, in which 13,199 patients with a nonsevere ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack who had not received intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis and were not considered to have had a cardioembolic stroke were randomly assigned within 24 hours after symptom onset, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily for days 2 through 90) or aspirin (300 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for days 2 through 90). The primary end point was the time to the occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days.
RESULTS: During the 90 days of treatment, a primary end-point event occurred in 442 of the 6589 patients (6.7\%) treated with ticagrelor, versus 497 of the 6610 patients (7.5\%) treated with aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.01; P=0.07). Ischemic stroke occurred in 385 patients (5.8\%) treated with ticagrelor and in 441 patients (6.7\%) treated with aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.76 to 1.00). Major bleeding occurred in 0.5\% of patients treated with ticagrelor and in 0.6\% of patients treated with aspirin, intracranial hemorrhage in 0.2\% and 0.3\%, respectively, and fatal bleeding in 0.1\% and 0.1\%.
CONCLUSIONS: In our trial involving patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, ticagrelor was not found to be superior to aspirin in reducing the rate of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death at 90 days. (Funded by AstraZeneca; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01994720.).},

	abstract = {Importance: Antithrombotic therapies are known to prevent stroke for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but are often underused in community practice.
Objectives: To examine the prevalence of patients with acute ischemic stroke with known history of AF who were not receiving guideline-recommended antithrombotic treatment before stroke and to determine the association of preceding antithrombotic therapy with stroke severity and in-hospital outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective observational study of 94 474 patients with acute ischemic stroke and known history of AF admitted from October 2012 through March 2015 to 1622 hospitals participating in the Get With the Guidelines-Stroke program.
Exposures: Antithrombotic therapy before stroke.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Stroke severity as measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS; range of 0-42, with a higher score indicating greater stroke severity and a score ≥16 indicating moderate or severe stroke), and in-hospital mortality.
Results: Of 94 474 patients (mean [SD] age, 79.9 [11.0] years; 57.0\% women), 7176 (7.6\%) were receiving therapeutic warfarin (international normalized ratio [INR] ≥2) and 8290 (8.8\%) were receiving non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) preceding the stroke. A total of 79 008 patients (83.6\%) were not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation; 12 751 (13.5\%) had subtherapeutic warfarin anticoagulation (INR {\textless}2) at the time of stroke, 37 674 (39.9\%) were receiving antiplatelet therapy only, and 28 583 (30.3\%) were not receiving any antithrombotic treatment. Among 91 155 high-risk patients (prestroke CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2), 76 071 (83.5\%) were not receiving therapeutic warfarin or NOACs before stroke. The unadjusted rates of moderate or severe stroke were lower among patients receiving therapeutic warfarin (15.8\% [95\% CI, 14.8\%-16.7\%]) and NOACs (17.5\% [95\% CI, 16.6\%-18.4\%]) than among those receiving no antithrombotic therapy (27.1\% [95\% CI, 26.6\%-27.7\%]), antiplatelet therapy only (24.8\% [95\% CI, 24.3\%-25.3\%]), or subtherapeutic warfarin (25.8\% [95\% CI, 25.0\%-26.6\%]); unadjusted rates of in-hospital mortality also were lower for those receiving therapeutic warfarin (6.4\% [95\% CI, 5.8\%-7.0\%]) and NOACs (6.3\% [95\% CI, 5.7\%-6.8\%]) compared with those receiving no antithrombotic therapy (9.3\% [95\% CI, 8.9\%-9.6\%]), antiplatelet therapy only (8.1\% [95\% CI, 7.8\%-8.3\%]), or subtherapeutic warfarin (8.8\% [95\% CI, 8.3\%-9.3\%]). After adjusting for potential confounders, compared with no antithrombotic treatment, preceding use of therapeutic warfarin, NOACs, or antiplatelet therapy was associated with lower odds of moderate or severe stroke (adjusted odds ratio [95\% CI], 0.56 [0.51-0.60], 0.65 [0.61-0.71], and 0.88 [0.84-0.92], respectively) and in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [95\% CI], 0.75 [0.67-0.85], 0.79 [0.72-0.88], and 0.83 [0.78-0.88], respectively).
Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with atrial fibrillation who had experienced an acute ischemic stroke, inadequate therapeutic anticoagulation preceding the stroke was prevalent. Therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with lower odds of moderate or severe stroke and lower odds of in-hospital mortality.},

In the new era of genomics, the challenging interpretation of individual genetic variations requires an accurate phenotypic description and classification. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–based approaches have been proposed to improve the diagnostic process of adult-onset leukoencephalopathies. Cerebral calcifications, when associated with white matter hyperintensities, are of major importance in the decision-making process to focus the diagnosis among the diversity of rare causes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Observations{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}This literature review demonstrated that the morphologic features and topography of the calcifications observed in a careful combined analysis of computed tomographic and MRI scans may help indicate the diagnosis of adult-onset genetic leukoencephalopathies. Vascular genetic leukoencephalopathies are an important cause of leukoencephalopathy with calcifications. Among them,\textit{COL4A1}-related disorders are frequently associated with spotlike calcifications in the basal ganglia. Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids, a probably underestimated disorder, is associated with a specific pattern of calcifications: small, symmetric, sparing the basal ganglia, and a stepping stone appearance in the frontal pericallosal region. Moreover, disorders primarily associated with basal ganglia calcifications, such as primary familial brain calcifications, can be associated with marked leukoencephalopathy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions and Relevance{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The number of identified causes of adult-onset genetic leukoencephalopathies has recently increased.

	abstract = {The neuron doctrine is the concept that the nervous system is made up of discrete individual cells, a discovery due to decisive neuro-anatomical work of Santiago Ramón y Cajal and later presented by, among others, H. Waldeyer-Hartz. The term neuron (spelled neurone in British English) was itself coined by Waldeyer as a way of identifying the cells in question. The neuron doctrine, as it became known, served to position neurons as special cases under the broader cell theory evolved some decades earlier. He appropriated the concept not from his own research but from the disparate observation of the histological work of Albert von Kölliker, Camillo Golgi, Franz Nissl, Santiago Ramón y Cajal, Auguste Forel and others.},

Although Golgi's view was not the result of incisive reasoning based on subsequently confirmed observation, both principles espoused by these combatant Nobel laureate partners have proven robustly operative in different spheres and time frames of neural activity that have vastly enhanced contemporary understanding of neural connectivity.},

	abstract = {Background
Assessing resident well-being is becoming increasingly important from a programmatic standpoint. Two measures that have been used to assess this are the Clance Impostor Scale (CIS) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS). However, little is known about the relationship between the two phenomena.

Objectives
To explore the prevalence and association between impostorism and burnout syndrome in a sample of internal medicine residents.

Design
Anonymous, cross-sectional postal survey.

Participants
Forty-eight internal medicine residents (postgraduate year [PGY] 1–3) at the Schulich School of Medicine \& Dentistry (62.3\% response rate).

Measurements and Main Results
Short demographic questionnaire, CIS and MBI-HSS. Impostorism and burnout syndrome were identified in 43.8\% and 12.5\% of residents, respectively. With the exception of a negative correlation between CIS scores and the MBI’s personal accomplishment subscale (r = −.30; 95\% CI −.54 to −.02), no other significant relations were identified. Foreign-trained residents were more likely to score as impostors (odds ratio [OR] 10.7; 95\% CI 1.2 to 98.2) while senior residents were more likely to experience burnout syndrome (OR 16.5 95\% CI 1.6 to 168.5).

Conclusions
Both impostorism and burnout syndrome appear to be threats to resident well-being in our program. The lack of relationship between the two would suggest that programs and researchers wishing to address the issue of resident distress should consider using both measures. The finding that foreign-trained residents appear to be more susceptible to impostorism warrants further study.},

The model is a mathematical equation that connects the outcome of interest with the predictors. A new patient with given clinical characteristics can be predicted for outcome with this model. However, the equation describing the relationship between predictors and outcome is often complex and the computation requires software for practical use. There is another method called nomogram which is a graphical calculating device allowing an approximate graphical computation of a mathematical function. In this article, we describe how to draw nomograms for various outcomes with nomogram() function. Binary outcome is fit by logistic regression model and the outcome of interest is the probability of the event of interest. Ordinal outcome variable is also discussed. Survival analysis can be fit with parametric model to fully describe the distributions of survival time. Statistics such as the median survival time, survival probability up to a specific time point are taken as the outcome of interest.},

In this study, we measured C5aR level by immunohistochemistry in the same cohort of our previous C5a research, and C5a-C5aR axis status was determined by synthesizing C5a and C5aR data. C5aR was an adverse independent prognostic factor for ccRCC patients. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed the unique position of both C5a and C5aR high population in postoperative survival, based on which patients were then shunted into C5a-C5aR enriched and non-enriched groups. Obviously, C5a-C5aR enriched patients significantly had a poorer overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) compared with non-enriched ones, and the independence of C5a-C5aR axis was verified by multivariable analyses (HR 2.118, P = 0.001 for OS, HR 1.715, P = 0.035 for RFS). Established nomograms based on our findings reflected much better predicting accuracy in contrast with most common used TNM and Fuhrman systems. Meanwhile, consistent with HR, C5a-C5aR axis in this study held its advantages over C5a and C5aR for OS prediction by c-index analyses, rather than RFS prediction.},

Emergency department predictors were measured either on admission with mTBI—comprising injury severity (GCS score, post-traumatic amnesia, and CT abnormalities), demographics (age, gender, educational level, pre-injury mental health, and previous brain injury), and physical conditions (alcohol use on the day of injury, neck pain, headache, nausea, dizziness)—or at 2 weeks, when we obtained data on mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), emotional distress (Impact of Event Scale), coping (Utrecht Coping List), and post-traumatic complaints. The functional outcome was recovery, assessed at 6 months after injury with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE). We dichotomised recovery into complete (GOSE=8) and incomplete (GOSE≤7) recovery. We used logistic regression analyses to assess the predictive value of patient information collected at the time of admission to an emergency department (eg, demographics, injury severity) alone, and combined with predictors of outcome collected at 2 weeks after injury (eg, emotional distress and coping).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Between Jan 25, 2013, and Jan 6, 2015, data from 910 patients with mTBI were collected 2 weeks after injury; the final date for 6-month follow-up was July 6, 2015. Of these patients, 764 (84\%) had post-traumatic complaints and 414 (45\%) showed emotional distress. At 6 months after injury, outcome data were available for 671 patients; complete recovery (GOSE=8) was observed in 373 (56\%) patients and incomplete recovery (GOSE ≤7) in 298 (44\%) patients.

Patient and tumor characteristics were included as covariates, and their association with overall survival and disease-free survival with and without adjuvant chemotherapy was assessed. The model was internally validated for discrimination and calibration using bootstrap resampling. To externally validate the model, data were included from a validation cohort of 973 patients with stage II or stage III gastric cancer who met the inclusion criteria and underwent surgery at First Affiliated Hospital in Guangzhou, China, and at West China Hospital of Sichuan Hospital in Chendu, China, between January 1, 2000, and June 30, 2009.

Network neuroscience proposes to tackle these enduring challenges. Approaching brain structure and function from an explicitly integrative perspective, network neuroscience pursues new ways to map, record, analyze and model the elements and interactions of neurobiological systems. Two parallel trends drive the approach: the availability of new empirical tools to create comprehensive maps and record dynamic patterns among molecules, neurons, brain areas and social systems; and the theoretical framework and computational tools of modern network science. The convergence of empirical and computational advances opens new frontiers of scientific inquiry, including network dynamics, manipulation and control of brain networks, and integration of network processes across spatiotemporal domains. We review emerging trends in network neuroscience and attempt to chart a path toward a better understanding of the brain as a multiscale networked system.},

The regulations' infirmities will be demonstrated by applying them to facts relating to the central charge in the misconduct case pressed by the University of Arizona in 1997 through 2003 against then Arizona Regents' Professor Marguerite Kay, which facts are set forth in our companion piece in this theme issue.},

Here we describe PET-based measurements of brain glucose uptake, oxygen utilization, and blood flow in cognitively normal adults from 20 to 82 years of age. Age-related decreases in brain glucose uptake exceed that of oxygen use, resulting in loss of brain aerobic glycolysis (AG). Whereas the topographies of total brain glucose uptake, oxygen utilization, and blood flow remain largely stable with age, brain AG topography changes significantly. Brain regions with high AG in young adults show the greatest change, as do regions with prolonged developmental transcriptional features (i.e., neoteny). The normal aging human brain thus undergoes characteristic metabolic changes, largely driven by global loss and topographic changes in brain AG.},

We show that in meiosis, Eso1 is required for establishing core centromere cohesion during S phase, whereas Moa1 is required for maintaining this cohesion after S phase.

ZIKV-E resembles all the known flavivirus E structures but contains a unique, positively charged patch adjacent to the fusion loop region of the juxtaposed monomer, which may influence host attachment. The ZIKV-E-2A10G6 complex structure reveals antibody recognition of a highly conserved fusion loop. 2A10G6 binds to ZIKV-E with high affinity in vitro and neutralizes currently circulating ZIKV strains in vitro and in mice.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pmed.1002203},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) stated in March 2016 that there was scientific consensus that the mosquito-borne Zika virus was a cause of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and of microcephaly and other congenital brain abnormalities based on rapid evidence assessments. Decisions about causality require systematic assessment to guide public health actions. The objectives of this study were to update and reassess the evidence for causality through a rapid and systematic review about links between Zika virus infection and (a) congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the foetuses and offspring of pregnant women and (b) GBS in any population, and to describe the process and outcomes of an expert assessment of the evidence about causality.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study had three linked components. First, in February 2016, we developed a causality framework that defined questions about the relationship between Zika virus infection and each of the two clinical outcomes in ten dimensions: temporality, biological plausibility, strength of association, alternative explanations, cessation, dose-response relationship, animal experiments, analogy, specificity, and consistency. Second, we did a systematic review (protocol number CRD42016036693). We searched multiple online sources up to May 30, 2016 to find studies that directly addressed either outcome and any causality dimension, used methods to expedite study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment, and summarised evidence descriptively. Third, WHO convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts who assessed the review findings and reached consensus statements to update the WHO position on causality. We found 1,091 unique items up to May 30, 2016. For congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, we included 72 items; for eight of ten causality dimensions (all except dose-response relationship and specificity), we found that more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association with Zika virus infection. For GBS, we included 36 items, of which more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association in seven of ten dimensions (all except dose-response relationship, specificity, and animal experimental evidence). Articles identified nonsystematically from May 30 to July 29, 2016 strengthened the review findings. The expert panel concluded that (a) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and clusters of microcephaly is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including microcephaly, and (b) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and GBS is that Zika virus infection is a trigger of GBS. The expert panel recognised that Zika virus alone may not be sufficient to cause either congenital brain abnormalities or GBS but agreed that the evidence was sufficient to recommend increased public health measures. Weaknesses are the limited assessment of the role of dengue virus and other possible cofactors, the small number of comparative epidemiological studies, and the difficulty in keeping the review up to date with the pace of publication of new research.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and systematic reviews with frequent updating and open dissemination are now needed both for appraisal of the evidence about Zika virus infection and for the next public health threats that will emerge. This systematic review found sufficient evidence to say that Zika virus is a cause of congenital abnormalities and is a trigger of GBS.},

	abstract = {Zika virus was discovered ∼70 years ago in Uganda and maintained a low profile as a human disease agent in Africa and Asia. Only recently has it caused explosive outbreaks in previously unaffected regions, first in Oceania and then in the Americas since 2015. Of special concern is the newly identified link between congenital malformations (especially microcephaly) and Zika virus infections during pregnancy. At present, it is unclear whether Zika virus changed its pathogenicity or whether the huge number of infections allowed the recognition of a previously cryptic pathogenic property. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent data on the molecular antigenic structure of Zika virus in the context of antibody-mediated neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, a phenomenon that has been implicated in the development of severe disease caused by the related dengue viruses. Emphasis is given to epitopes of antibodies that potently neutralize Zika virus and also to epitopes that provide antigenic links to other important human-pathogenic flaviviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. The antigenic cross talk between Zika and dengue viruses appears to be of special importance, since they cocirculate in many regions of endemicity and sequential infections are likely to occur frequently. New insights into the molecular antigenic structure of Zika virus and flaviviruses in general have provided the foundation for great progress made in developing Zika virus vaccines and antibodies for passive immunization.},

This has resulted in ZIKV being declared a public health emergency and has greatly accelerated the pace of ZIKV research and discovery. Within a short time period, useful mouse and non-human primate disease models have been established, and pre-clinical evaluation of therapeutics and vaccines has begun. Unexpectedly, ZIKV exhibits a broad tropism and persistence in body tissues and fluids, which contributes to the clinical manifestations and epidemiology that have been observed during the current epidemic. In this Review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis, tissue tropism, and the resulting pathology and discuss areas for future investigation.},

The burden of dengue has expanded for decades, and now affects more than 120 countries. Complex, large-scale global forces have and will continue to contribute to the expansion of dengue, including population growth, unplanned urbanisation, and suboptimal mosquito control in urban centres. Although no so-called magic bullets are available, there is new optimism following the first licensure of a dengue vaccine and other promising vaccine candidates, and the development of novel vector control interventions to help control dengue and other expanding mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika virus. Implementation of effective and sustainable immunisation programmes to complement existing methods will add complexity to the health systems of affected countries, which have varying levels of robustness and maturity. Long-term high prioritisation and adequate resources are needed. The way forward is full commitment to addressing a complex disease with a set of solutions integrating vaccination and vector control methods. A whole systems approach is thus needed to integrate these various approaches and strategies for controlling dengue within the goal of universal health coverage. The ultimate objective of these interventions will be to reduce the disease burden in a sustainable and equitable manner.},

Since the World Health Organization declared the ZIKV outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, remarkable progress has been made to gain insight into cellular targets, pathogenesis, and underlying biological mechanisms of ZIKV infection. Here we review the current knowledge and progress in understanding the impact of ZIKV exposure on the mammalian brain development and discuss potential underlying mechanisms.},

Significant progress has been made in our understanding of the interactions between ZIKV and the pregnant host, but there is still a critical need to understand how ZIKV and other neurotropic viruses affect fetal neurodevelopment. Diaphanous-related formins (Diaphs) have recently been identified as microcephaly-associated proteins in humans and mice. Mutations in Diaphs affect the function of neural progenitor cells, much like prenatal viral infection. We present a novel hypothesis that viruses 'hijack' Diaphs in neural progenitor cells, causing autonomous differentiation and apoptosis of neural progenitor cells, which could potentially contribute to virus-associated neurological pathologies.},

Additionally, pre-existing immunity to related flaviviruses could generate cross-reactive T cells that may affect immune responses upon vaccination.

Potential molecular targets for broad-spectrum antiflaviviral compounds include viral proteins, such as the viral protease or polymerase, and host targets that are exploited by these viruses during entry and replication, including α-glucosidase and proteins involved in nucleoside biosynthesis. Numerous compounds with broad-spectrum antiviral activity have already been identified by target-specific or phenotypic assays.

Zika virus emerged in Brazil in 2015 and was declared a national public health emergency after local researchers and physicians reported an increase in microcephaly cases. In 2016, WHO declared the recent cluster of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders reported in Brazil a global public health emergency. Similar clusters of microcephaly cases were also observed retrospectively in French Polynesia in 2014. In 2015-16, Zika virus continued its spread to cause outbreaks in the Americas and the Pacific, and the first outbreaks were reported in continental USA, Africa, and southeast Asia. Non-vector-borne transmission was confirmed and Zika virus was established as a cause of severe neurological complications in fetuses, neonates, and adults.

Because of the similarity of Zika and dengue viruses, an analogous unwanted outcome might occur with some Zika virus vaccine designs. A successful Zika virus vaccine requires challenge experiments that are done at long intervals after immunisation and that identify protection as the absence of viraemia and the absence of an anamnestic antibody response.

Modeling this association in animals shows that maternal immune activation negatively affects fetal brain development and leads to the emergence of behavioral disturbances later in life. Recent discoveries in these preclinical models suggest that epigenetic modifications may be a critical molecular mechanism by which prenatal immune activation can mediate changes in brain development and functions, even across generations. This review discusses the potential epigenetic mechanisms underlying the effects of prenatal infections, thereby highlighting how infection-mediated epigenetic reprogramming may contribute to the transgenerational transmission of pathological traits. The identification of epigenetic and transgenerational mechanisms in infection-mediated neurodevelopmental disorders appears relevant to brain disorders independently of existing diagnostic classifications and may help identifying complex patterns of transgenerational disease transmission beyond genetic inheritance. The consideration of ancestral infectious histories may be of great clinical interest and may be pivotal for developing new preventive treatment strategies against infection-mediated neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can cause fetal developmental abnormalities and Guillain–Barré syndrome in adults. Although progress has been made in understanding the link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly, the pathology of ZIKV, particularly the viral reservoirs in human, remains poorly understood. Several studies have shown that compared to serum samples, patients’ urine samples often have a longer duration of ZIKV persistency and higher viral load. This finding suggests that an independent viral reservoir may exist in the human urinary system. Despite the clinical observations, the host cells of ZIKV in the human urinary system are poorly characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that ZIKV can infect renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTEpiCs) in immunodeficient mice in vivo and in both immortalized and primary human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (hRPTEpiCs) in vitro. Importantly, ZIKV infection in mouse kidneys caused caspase-3-mediated apoptosis of renal cells. Similarly, in vitro infection of immortalized and primary hRPTEpiCs resulted in notable cytopathic effects. Consistent with the clinical observations, we found that ZIKV infection can persist with prolonged duration in hRPTEpiCs. RNA-Seq analyses of infected hRPTEpiCs revealed a large number of transcriptional changes in response to ZIKV infection, including type I interferon signaling genes and anti-viral response genes. Our results suggest that hRPTEpiCs are a potential reservoir of ZIKV in the human urinary system, providing a possible explanation for the prolonged persistency of ZIKV in patients’ urine.},

Pragmatic trials are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in real-life routine practice conditions, whereas explanatory trials aim to test whether an intervention works under optimal situations. Pragmatic trials produce results that can be generalized and applied in routine practice settings. Since most results from exploratory trials fail to be broadly generalizable, the “pragmatic design” has gained momentum. This review describes the concept of pragmatism, and explains in particular that there is a continuum between pragmatic and explanatory trials, rather than a dichotomy. Special focus is put on the limitations of the pragmatic trials, while recognizing the importance for and impact of this design on medical practice.},

	abstract = {YAP supports dopaminergic neurons
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons and motor control. Various factors promote or inhibit neuronal survival. Zhang et al. found that a prosurvival signal was mediated by the transcription cofactor YAP. YAP was activated in midbrain dopaminergic neurons in culture and in mice through an interaction between an integrin and the extracellular matrix protein laminin-511. YAP then transcriptionally activated dopaminergic neuron differentiation factors and a microRNA that decreased the synthesis of the apoptotic protein PTEN. The findings uncover a new role for YAP in neurons and a pathway that might be explored for the purpose of promoting dopaminergic neuron survival in PD patients.
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain (mDA neurons) causes progressive loss of motor control and function. Using embryonic and mDA neurons, midbrain tissue from mice, and differentiated human neural stem cells, we investigated the mechanisms controlling the survival of mDA neurons. We found that the extracellular matrix protein laminin-511 (LM511) promoted the survival and differentiation of mDA neurons. LM511 bound to integrin α3β1 and activated the transcriptional cofactor YAP. LM511-YAP signaling enhanced cell survival by inducing the expression of the microRNA miR-130a, which suppressed the synthesis of the cell death–associated protein PTEN. In addition, LM511-YAP signaling increased the expression of transcription factors critical for mDA identity, such as LMX1A and PITX3, and prevented the loss of mDA neurons in response to oxidative stress, a finding that warrants further investigation to assess therapeutic potential for PD patients. We propose that by enhancing LM511-YAP signaling, it may be possible to prevent mDA neuron degeneration in PD or enhance the survival of mDA neurons in cell replacement therapies.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare speed and accuracy of graphical data extraction using manual estimation and open source software.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Data points from eligible graphs/figures published in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 2009 to 2014 were extracted by two authors independently, both by manual estimation and with the Plot Digitizer, open source software. Corresponding authors of each RCT were contacted up to four times via e-mail to obtain exact numbers that were used to create graphs. Accuracy of each method was compared against the source data from which the original graphs were produced.
RESULTS: Software data extraction was significantly faster, reducing time for extraction for 47\%. Percent agreement between the two raters was 51\% for manual and 53.5\% for software data extraction. Percent agreement between the raters and original data was 66\% vs. 75\% for the first rater and 69\% vs. 73\% for the second rater, for manual and software extraction, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Data extraction from figures should be conducted using software, whereas manual estimation should be avoided. Using software for data extraction of data presented only in figures is faster and enables higher interrater reliability.},

Graphs might be considered visual take-home lessons of the major point(s) of the manuscript. In choosing a graph, it is tempting to concentrate only on ways of illustrating summary statements characterizing the group(s). However, individual patients are unique, and their characteristics or outcomes may not be predicted by a group summary. Consequently, if possible, graphs should demonstrate individual responses as well as group summaries. "Graphical literacy," "graphical excellence," and "graphical acumen" are achievable with work and collaboration. To produce a well-designed graph, a combination of by-subject detail and overall results should be the goal within the same illustration. The practice gap addressed in this article is that little attention from authors, reviewers, editors, and publishers seems to be paid to graphical literacy. The purpose of this article is to present some practical guidelines for choosing or evaluating more appropriate data displays.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Specific reversal agents for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are lacking. Idarucizumab, an antibody fragment, was developed to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran.
METHODS: We undertook this prospective cohort study to determine the safety of 5 g of intravenous idarucizumab and its capacity to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in patients who had serious bleeding (group A) or required an urgent procedure (group B). The primary end point was the maximum percentage reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within 4 hours after the administration of idarucizumab, on the basis of the determination at a central laboratory of the dilute thrombin time or ecarin clotting time. A key secondary end point was the restoration of hemostasis.
RESULTS: This interim analysis included 90 patients who received idarucizumab (51 patients in group A and 39 in group B). Among 68 patients with an elevated dilute thrombin time and 81 with an elevated ecarin clotting time at baseline, the median maximum percentage reversal was 100\% (95\% confidence interval, 100 to 100). Idarucizumab normalized the test results in 88 to 98\% of the patients, an effect that was evident within minutes. Concentrations of unbound dabigatran remained below 20 ng per milliliter at 24 hours in 79\% of the patients. Among 35 patients in group A who could be assessed, hemostasis, as determined by local investigators, was restored at a median of 11.4 hours. Among 36 patients in group B who underwent a procedure, normal intraoperative hemostasis was reported in 33, and mildly or moderately abnormal hemostasis was reported in 2 patients and 1 patient, respectively. One thrombotic event occurred within 72 hours after idarucizumab administration in a patient in whom anticoagulants had not been reinitiated.

	doi = {10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.01.042},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modifications in left atrial (LA) flow velocities after left atrial appendage (LAA) exclusion have been shown in animal and ex vivo models. In a substudy of PROTECT AF (Percutaneous Closure of the Left Atrial Appendage Versus Warfarin Therapy for Prevention of Stroke in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation), an objective improvement in quality of life was observed after LAA closure.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of LAA closure on LA transport function.
METHODS: Comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography evaluation (2-dimensional [2D]/3-dimensional [3D], 2D speckle tracking) was prospectively performed before and after LAA closure (at discharge and 45 days after procedure) in 33 patients.
RESULTS: LAA closure was associated with a significant improvement in LA reservoir function at discharge and 45 days after the procedure with (1) increased maximum LA volume index, (2) increased 2D-LA reservoir volume and expansion index, and (3) increased 2D speckle tracking-derived peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS) (27.9 ± 14 and 26 ± 12.6 vs 21.7 ± 10.7\%, P {\textless}.0001). LAA closure was also associated with a significant improvement in LA contractile function with (1) increased LA ejection fraction and (2) increased speckle tracking-derived peak atrial contraction strain (PACS) in sinus rhythm patients (19.1 ± 6.8 and 18.1 ± 5.4 vs 14.4 ± 6.4\%, P = .0006). Conversely, the slope of the relation between PACS and PALS remained unchanged (0.5 ± 0.27 and 0.53 ± 0.3 vs 0.5 ± 0.25, P = .99), thus arguing for an improvement in LA contractile function secondary to a Frank-Starling effect rather than a modification in its intrinsic contractility.
CONCLUSION: LAA closure was associated with an improvement in LA mechanical function. These changes appeared to be related to a modification in loading conditions, that is, a Frank-Starling effect.},

We interrogated 54 to 70 genes in 442 patients with CUP using targeted clinical-grade, next-generation sequencing of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Overall, 80\% of patients exhibited ctDNA alterations; 66\% (290/442) ≥1 characterized alteration(s), excluding variants of unknown significance. TP53-associated genes were most commonly altered [37.8\% (167/442)], followed by genes involved in the MAPK pathway [31.2\% (138/442)], PI3K signaling [18.1\% (80/442)], and the cell-cycle machinery [10.4\% (46/442)]. Among 290 patients harboring characterized alterations, distinct genomic profiles were observed in 87.9\% (255/290) of CUP cases, with 99.7\% (289/290) exhibiting potentially targetable alterations. An illustrative patient with dynamic changes in ctDNA content during therapy and a responder given a checkpoint inhibitor-based regimen because of a mismatch repair gene anomaly are presented. Our results demonstrate that ctDNA evaluation is feasible in CUP and that most patients harbor a unique somatic profile with pharmacologically actionable alterations, justifying the inclusion of noninvasive liquid biopsies in next-generation clinical trials.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for recurrent ischaemic stroke, but often remains undiagnosed in patients who have had an acute ischaemic stroke. Enhanced and prolonged Holter-electrocardiogram-monitoring might increase detection of atrial fibrillation. We therefore investigated whether enhanced and prolonged rhythm monitoring was better for detection of atrial fibrillation than standard care procedures in patients with acute ischaemic stroke.
METHODS: Find-AFrandomised is an open-label randomised study done at four centres in Germany. We recruited patients with acute ischaemic stroke (symptoms for 7 days or less) aged 60 years or older presenting with sinus rhythm and without history of atrial fibrillation. Patients were included irrespective of the suspected cause of stroke, unless they had a severe ipsilateral carotid or intracranial artery stenosis, which were the exclusion criteria. We used a computer-generated allocation sequence to randomly assign patients in a 1:1 ratio with permuted block sizes of 2, 4, 6, and 8, stratified by centre, to enhanced and prolonged monitoring (ie, 10-day Holter-electrocardiogram [ECG]-monitoring at baseline, and at 3 months and 6 months of follow-up) or standard care procedures (ie, at least 24 h of rhythm monitoring). Participants and study physicians were not masked to group assignment, but the expert committees that adjudicated endpoints were. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (30 sec or longer) within 6 months after randomisation and before stroke recurrence. Because Holter ECG is a widely used procedure and not known to harm patients, we chose not to assess safety in detail. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01855035.
FINDINGS: Between May 8, 2013, and Aug 31, 2014, we recruited 398 patients. 200 patients were randomly assigned to the enhanced and prolonged monitoring group and 198 to the standard care group. After 6 months, we detected atrial fibrillation in 14\% of 200 patients in the enhanced and prolonged monitoring group (27 patients) versus 5\% in the control group (nine of 198 patients, absolute difference 9·0\%; 95\% CI 3·4-14·5, p=0·002; number needed to screen 11).
INTERPRETATION: Enhanced and prolonged monitoring initiated early in patients with acute ischaemic stroke aged 60 years or older was better than standard care for the detection of atrial fibrillation. These findings support the consideration of all patients aged 60 years or older with stroke for prolonged monitoring if the detection of atrial fibrillation would result in a change in medical management (eg, initiation of anticoagulation).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is fatal unless treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Delay in diagnosis is common without newborn screening. Family history of infant death due to infection or known SCID (FH) has been associated with earlier diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the clinical features that affect age at diagnosis (AD) and time to the diagnosis of SCID.
METHODS: From 2005 to 2016, 147 SCID patients were referred to the Asian Primary Immunodeficiency Network. Patients with genetic diagnosis, age at presentation (AP), and AD were selected for study.
RESULTS: A total of 88 different SCID gene mutations were identified in 94 patients, including 49 IL2RG mutations, 12 RAG1 mutations, 8 RAG2 mutations, 7 JAK3 mutations, 4 DCLRE1C mutations, 4 IL7R mutations, 2 RFXANK mutations, and 2 ADA mutations. A total of 29 mutations were previously unreported. Eighty-three of the 94 patients fulfilled the selection criteria. Their median AD was 4 months, and the time to diagnosis was 2 months. The commonest SCID was X-linked (n = 57). A total of 29 patients had a positive FH. Candidiasis (n = 27) and bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine infection (n = 19) were the commonest infections. The median age for candidiasis and BCG infection documented were 3 months and 4 months, respectively. The median absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was 1.05 × 10(9)/L with over 88\% patients below 3 × 10(9)/L. Positive FH was associated with earlier AP by 1 month (p = 0.002) and diagnosis by 2 months (p = 0.008), but not shorter time to diagnosis (p = 0.494). Candidiasis was associated with later AD by 2 months (p = 0.008) and longer time to diagnosis by 0.55 months (p = 0.003). BCG infections were not associated with age or time to diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: FH was useful to aid earlier diagnosis but was overlooked by clinicians and not by parents. Similarly, typical clinical features of SCID were not recognized by clinicians to shorten the time to diagnosis. We suggest that lymphocyte subset should be performed for any infant with one or more of the following four clinical features: FH, candidiasis, BCG infections, and ALC below 3 × 10(9)/L.},

Gene-specific variant databases (locus-specific variation databases, LSDBs) are typically curated and maintained for single genes or groups of genes for a certain disease(s). These databases are widely considered as the most reliable information source for a particular gene/protein/disease, but it should also be made clear they may have widely varying contents, infrastructure, and quality. Quality is very important to evaluate because these databases may affect health decision-making, research, and clinical practice. The Human Variome Project (HVP) established a Working Group for Variant Database Quality Assessment. The basic principle was to develop a simple system that nevertheless provides a good overview of the quality of a database. The HVP quality evaluation criteria that resulted are divided into four main components: data quality, technical quality, accessibility, and timeliness. This report elaborates on the developed quality criteria and how implementation of the quality scheme can be achieved. Examples are provided for the current status of the quality items in two different databases, BTKbase, an LSDB, and ClinVar, a central archive of submissions about variants and their clinical significance.},

Here, we report CNVs identified using Illumina Human Omni 2.5M oligonucleotide microarrays in 11 multiplex families with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) referred to Autism Research and Treatment Center (ART) and Madinah Maternity and Children Hospital (MMCH). Of the 11 families, 22 patients with ASD (all males) and their parents, were recruited for the present study. In total, 43 individuals were genotyped with high-resolution array. Abnormal microarray results were seen in all 22 patients with ASD. A total of 17 shared CNVs were selected for further analysis. Out of these 17 CNVs, we discovered one novel CNV, previously not described, and 16 recurrent CNVs that overlap with the genomic imbalances defined in the autism database, autism chromosome rearrangement database and database of genomic variants. Recurrent CNVs include 11 common and 5 rare CNVs. All rare CNVs are duplications except a 16-kb deletion on chr2q36.3. Rare gain of copy numbers includes a 2-kb duplication on chr9q21.13, overlapping duplications of 107kb and 181kb on chrXp22.33 in 2 different families and a 10-kb duplication on chr18q21.13. A novel loss of copy number on chr3q23 was found in four ASD cases. This CNV results in deletion of intron 2 of calsyntenin 2 (CLSTN2) encoding synaptic protein calsyntenin 2. CLSTN2 is expressed exclusively in the brain, with high levels occurring in cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons and in medial temporal lobe regions. These results verify the diagnostic relevance of genome-wide small common and rare CNVs and provide further evidence of the high diagnostic yield of microarray for genetic testing in children with ASD.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of distinctive EGFr cysteine altering NOTCH3 mutations in the 60,706 exomes of the exome aggregation consortium (ExAC) database.
METHODS: ExAC was queried for mutations distinctive for cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), namely mutations leading to a cysteine amino acid change in one of the 34 EGFr domains of NOTCH3. The genotype-phenotype correlation predicted by the ExAC data was tested in an independent cohort of Dutch CADASIL patients using quantified MRI lesions. The Dutch CADASIL registry was probed for paucisymptomatic individuals older than 70 years.
RESULTS: We identified 206 EGFr cysteine altering NOTCH3 mutations in ExAC, with a total prevalence of 3.4/1000. More than half of the distinct mutations have been previously reported in CADASIL patients. Despite the clear overlap, the mutation distribution in ExAC differs from that in reported CADASIL patients, as mutations in ExAC are predominantly located outside of EGFr domains 1-6. In an independent Dutch CADASIL cohort, we found that patients with a mutation in EGFr domains 7-34 have a significantly lower MRI lesion load than patients with a mutation in EGFr domains 1-6.
INTERPRETATION: The frequency of EGFr cysteine altering NOTCH3 mutations is 100-fold higher than expected based on estimates of CADASIL prevalence. This challenges the current CADASIL disease paradigm, and suggests that certain mutations may more frequently cause a much milder phenotype, which may even go clinically unrecognized. Our data suggest that individuals with a mutation located in EGFr domains 1-6 are predisposed to the more severe "classical" CADASIL phenotype, whereas individuals with a mutation outside of EGFr domains 1-6 can remain paucisymptomatic well into their eighth decade.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations of the PTCH1 gene have been found to contribute to both familial and sporadic basal cell carcinoma (BCC), especially in Caucasian patients. Furthermore, the majority of PTCH1 gene mutations in sporadic BCCs in Caucasian patients carry ultraviolet (UV) signatures, suggesting the key role of UV light in BCC development. However, sporadic BCC in non-Caucasian population has a lower incidence, and the pathogenesis remains largely unknown. To date, there has been no mutation analysis on PTCH1 gene in Chinese patients with sporadic BCCs.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate genetic alterations of the PTCH1 gene in Chinese sporadic BCCs.
METHODS: Direct sequencing was used to screen for mutations in PTCH1 in 31 microdissected samples in Chinese sporadic BCCs. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were studied for loss of heterozygosity (LOH).
RESULTS: Nineteen PTCH1 mutations in 17 of the 31 BCCs (54.8\%) were identified. SNP analysis revealed LOH of PTCH1 in 10 of 23 BCCs (43.5\%). Interestingly, the majority of mutations identified (63.2\%) were insertion/deletion, which was different from the results in Caucasian cases whose mutations are predominantly point mutations. Only two (10.5\%) of the remaining seven mutations were UV-specific C → T transition or tandem CC → TT transitions. All mutations occurred evenly throughout the entire PTCH1 protein domain without a hot-spot detected.
CONCLUSION: Mutations and LOH in PTCH1 were also highly prevalent in Chinese sporadic BCCs. However, UV light plays a less role in causing these mutations, suggesting other potential mechanisms in the development of sporadic BCC in Chinese patients.},

Following the recent trend, an increasing number of new and established databases deal with the issues of human health, from cancer-causing mutations to drugs and drug targets. In accordance with this trend, three recently compiled databases that have been selected by NAR reviewers and editors as ‘breakthrough’ contributions, denovo-db, the Monarch Initiative, and Open Targets, cover human de novo gene variants, disease-related phenotypes in model organisms, and a bioinformatics platform for therapeutic target identification and validation, respectively. We expect these databases to attract the attention of numerous researchers working in various areas of genetics and genomics. Looking back at the past 12 years, we present here the ‘golden set’ of databases that have consistently served as authoritative, comprehensive, and convenient data resources widely used by the entire community and offer some lessons on what makes a successful database.

In addition, the aggregate analysis of all information available in the databases provides unique opportunities to extract mutation characteristics and genotype-phenotype correlations, which would be otherwise unnoticed and unexplored. Such analyses revealed that 61.4\% of mutations are private to one single family, while only 5.7\% of mutations occur in 10 or more families. The five mutations with most frequent independent observations occur in 21\% of AD, 43\% of FTLD, and 48\% of PD families recorded in the Mutation Databases, respectively. Although these figures are inevitably biased by a publishing policy favoring novel mutations, they probably also reflect the occurrence of multiple rare and few relatively common mutations in the inherited forms of these diseases.

Over the past decades, great efforts have been made to elucidate the underlying genetic basis of CAD and massive data have been accumulated. To integrate these data together and to provide a useful resource for researchers, we developed the CADgene, a comprehensive database for CAD genes. We manually extracted CAD-related evidence for more than 300 candidate genes for CAD from over 1300 publications of genetic studies. We classified these candidate genes into 12 functional categories based on their roles in CAD. For each gene, we extracted detailed information from related studies (e.g. the size of case–control, population, SNP, odds ratio, P -value, etc.) and made useful annotations, which include general gene information, Gene Ontology annotations, KEGG pathways, protein–protein interactions and others. Besides the statistical number of studies for each gene, CADgene also provides tools to search and show the most frequently studied candidate genes. In addition, CADgene provides cumulative data from 11 publications of CAD-related genome-wide association studies. CADgene has a user-friendly web interface with multiple browse and search functions.

However, the resulted information is sparsely distributed and no systematical summarization has been made. In order to integrate these related results and facilitate the researches for the community, we conducted manual text-mining from published literature and built a database named as PubAngioGen (http://www.megabionet.org/aspd/). Our online application displays a comprehensive network for exploring the connection between angiogenesis and diseases at multilevels including protein–protein interaction, drug-target, disease-gene and signaling pathways among various cells and animal models recorded through text-mining. To enlarge the scope of the PubAngioGen application, our database also links to other common resources including STRING, DrugBank and OMIM databases, which will facilitate understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis and drug development in clinical therapy.},

CtDNA was assessed in plasma collected before the first (C0), second (C1) and/or third (C2) chemotherapy cycle, using picodroplet-digital PCR assays based either on detection of gene mutation (KRAS, BRAF, TP53) or hypermethylation (WIF1, NPY). CT scans were centrally assessed using RECIST v1.1 criteria. Multivariate analyses were adjusted on age, gender, ECOG performance status (PS), metastatic synchronicity, and treatment line.Results: Eighty-two patients with mCRC treated in first- (82.9\%) or second- (17.1\%) line chemotherapy were included. Patients with a high ({\textgreater}10 ng/mL) versus low (≤0.1 ng/mL) ctDNA concentration at C0 had a shorter overall survival (OS; 6.8 vs. 33.4 months: adjusted HR, 5.64; 95\% CI, 2.5-12.6; P {\textless} 0.0001). By analyzing the evolution of the ctDNA concentration between C0 and C2 or C1 (C2or1), we classified the patients in two groups (named "good" or "bad ctDNA responders"). In multivariate analysis, patients belonging to the group called "good ctDNA responder" (n = 58) versus "bad ctDNA responder" (n = 15) had a better objective response rate (P {\textless} 0.001), and a longer median progression-free survival (8.5 vs. 2.4 months: HR, 0.19; 95\% CI, 0.09-0.40; P {\textless} 0.0001) and OS (27.1 vs. 11.2 months: HR, 0.25; 95\% CI, 0.11-0.57; P {\textless} 0.001).Conclusions: This study suggests that early change in ctDNA concentration is a marker of therapeutic efficacy in patients with mCRC.

	abstract = {During pregnancy, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal blood encompasses a small percentage of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA), an easily accessible source for determination of fetal disease status in risk families through non-invasive procedures. In case of monogenic heritable disease, background maternal cfDNA prohibits direct observation of the maternally inherited allele. Non-invasive prenatal diagnostics (NIPD) of monogenic diseases therefore relies on parental haplotyping and statistical assessment of inherited alleles from cffDNA, techniques currently unavailable for routine clinical practice. Here, we present monogenic NIPD (MG-NIPD), which requires a blood sample from both parents, for targeted locus amplification (TLA)-based phasing of heterozygous variants selectively at a gene of interest. Capture probes-based targeted sequencing of cfDNA from the pregnant mother and a tailored statistical analysis enables predicting fetal gene inheritance. MG-NIPD was validated for 18 pregnancies, focusing on CFTR, CYP21A2, and HBB. In all cases we could predict the inherited alleles with {\textgreater}98\% confidence, even at relatively early stages (8 weeks) of pregnancy. This prediction and the accuracy of parental haplotyping was confirmed by sequencing of fetal material obtained by parallel invasive procedures. MG-NIPD is a robust method that requires standard instrumentation and can be implemented in any clinic to provide families carrying a severe monogenic disease with a prenatal diagnostic test based on a simple blood draw.},

	abstract = {We identified rare coding variants associated with Alzheimer's disease in a three-stage case-control study of 85,133 subjects. In stage 1, we genotyped 34,174 samples using a whole-exome microarray. In stage 2, we tested associated variants (P {\textless} 1 × 10(-4)) in 35,962 independent samples using de novo genotyping and imputed genotypes. In stage 3, we used an additional 14,997 samples to test the most significant stage 2 associations (P {\textless} 5 × 10(-8)) using imputed genotypes. We observed three new genome-wide significant nonsynonymous variants associated with Alzheimer's disease: a protective variant in PLCG2 (rs72824905: p.Pro522Arg, P = 5.38 × 10(-10), odds ratio (OR) = 0.68, minor allele frequency (MAF)cases = 0.0059, MAFcontrols = 0.0093), a risk variant in ABI3 (rs616338: p.Ser209Phe, P = 4.56 × 10(-10), OR = 1.43, MAFcases = 0.011, MAFcontrols = 0.008), and a new genome-wide significant variant in TREM2 (rs143332484: p.Arg62His, P = 1.55 × 10(-14), OR = 1.67, MAFcases = 0.0143, MAFcontrols = 0.0089), a known susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease. These protein-altering changes are in genes highly expressed in microglia and highlight an immune-related protein-protein interaction network enriched for previously identified risk genes in Alzheimer's disease. These genetic findings provide additional evidence that the microglia-mediated innate immune response contributes directly to the development of Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) are a promising source for a cell-based therapy to treat Parkinson’s disease (PD), in which midbrain dopaminergic neurons progressively degenerate. However, long-term analysis of human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic neurons in primate PD models has never been performed to our knowledge. Here we show that human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic progenitor cells survived and functioned as midbrain dopaminergic neurons in a primate model of PD (Macaca fascicularis) treated with the neurotoxin MPTP. Score-based and video-recording analyses revealed an increase in spontaneous movement of the monkeys after transplantation. Histological studies showed that the mature dopaminergic neurons extended dense neurites into the host striatum; this effect was consistent regardless of whether the cells were derived from patients with PD or from healthy individuals. Cells sorted by the floor plate marker CORIN did not form any tumours in the brains for at least two years. Finally, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography were used to monitor the survival, expansion and function of the grafted cells as well as the immune response in the host brain. Thus, this preclinical study using a primate model indicates that human iPS cell-derived dopaminergic progenitors are clinically applicable for the treatment of patients with PD.},

Dyslexia has been reported in every culture studied, and mounting evidence draws attention to cross-linguistic similarity in its neurobiological and neurocognitive bases. Much progress has been made across research specialties spanning the behavioural, neuropsychological, neurobiological, and causal levels of analysis in the past 5 years. From a neuropsychological perspective, the phonological theory remains the most compelling, although phonological problems also interact with other cognitive risk factors. Work confirms that, neurobiologically, dyslexia is characterised by dysfunction of the normal left hemisphere language network and also implicates abnormal white matter development. Studies accounting for reading experience demonstrate that many recorded neural differences show causes rather than effects of dyslexia. Six predisposing candidate genes have been identified, and evidence shows gene by environment interaction.},

METHODS: This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a reading and language intervention for 6-year-old children identified by research criteria as being at risk of dyslexia (n = 56), and their school-identified peers (n = 89). An Experimental group received two 9-week blocks of daily intervention delivered by trained teaching assistants; the Control group received 9 weeks of typical classroom instruction, followed by 9 weeks of intervention.
RESULTS: Following mixed effects regression models and path analyses, small-to-moderate effects were shown on letter knowledge, phoneme awareness and taught vocabulary. However, these were fragile and short lived, and there was no reliable effect on the primary outcome of word-level reading.
CONCLUSIONS: This new intervention was theoretically motivated and based on previous successful interventions, yet failed to show reliable effects on language and literacy measures following a rigorous evaluation. We suggest that the intervention may have been too short to yield improvements in oral language; and that literacy instruction in and beyond the classroom may have weakened training effects. We argue that reporting of null results makes an important contribution in terms of raising standards both of trial reporting and educational practice.},

Following mixed effects regression models and path analyses, small-to-moderate effects were shown on letter knowledge, phoneme awareness and taught vocabulary. However, these were fragile and short lived, and there was no reliable effect on the primary outcome of word-level reading.

Conclusions
This new intervention was theoretically motivated and based on previous successful interventions, yet failed to show reliable effects on language and literacy measures following a rigorous evaluation. We suggest that the intervention may have been too short to yield improvements in oral language; and that literacy instruction in and beyond the classroom may have weakened training effects. We argue that reporting of null results makes an important contribution in terms of raising standards both of trial reporting and educational practice.},

Thus, reading interventions designed to address each of these reading disorders differ in content.
METHOD: This review summarises the nature of dyslexia and reading comprehension impairment, and current understanding of best practice in associated reading interventions.
CONCLUSION: There is strong evidence for the effectiveness of phonological-based reading interventions in supporting children with dyslexic difficulties, and a growing understanding of how to meet the needs of children with reading comprehension impairment, with vocabulary instruction offering a promising approach. Although the content of interventions must be tailored to an individual's reader profile, general principles regarding the implementation and evaluation of intervention programmes can be extracted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and reading disability commonly co-occur because of shared genetic risk factors. However, the stability and change of these genetic influences and the predictive relationships underlying this association longitudinally remain unclear.
METHODS: ADHD symptoms and reading were assessed as continuous dimensions in a UK general population sample of approximately 7,000 twin pairs. Parent ratings of ADHD symptoms and teacher ratings of reading were obtained at two ages: middle childhood (ages 7-8 years) and early adolescence (ages 11-12 years). Cross-lagged quantitative genetic analyses were applied.
RESULTS: ADHD symptoms and reading significantly predicted each other over time. However, ADHD symptoms were a significantly stronger predictor of reading than vice versa. Inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms of ADHD both contributed to the prediction of reading, but inattentiveness was a significantly stronger predictor. Furthermore, ADHD symptoms and reading were highly heritable, and their association was primarily attributable to shared genetic influences. Despite notable genetic innovation for each trait, genetic factors involved in the association of ADHD symptoms and reading over time were highly stable.
CONCLUSIONS: ADHD symptoms may put children at increased risk for reading problems and vice versa. Moreover, enduring genetic mechanisms appear to be important in the association of ADHD symptoms and reading over time.},

The purpose of this paper is to review the literature regarding neuroimaging of reading intervention, with a particular focus on reading difficulties (RD). To locate relevant studies, searches of peer-reviewed literature were conducted using electronic databases to search for studies from the imaging modalities of fMRI and MEG (including MSI) that explored reading intervention. Of the 96 identified studies, 22 met the inclusion criteria for descriptive analysis. A subset of these (8 fMRI experiments with post-intervention data) was subjected to activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis to investigate differences in functional activation following reading intervention. Findings from the literature review suggest differences in functional activation of numerous brain regions associated with reading intervention, including bilateral inferior frontal, superior temporal, middle temporal, middle frontal, superior frontal, and postcentral gyri, as well as bilateral occipital cortex, inferior parietal lobules, thalami, and insulae. Findings from the meta-analysis indicate change in functional activation following reading intervention in the left thalamus, right insula/inferior frontal, left inferior frontal, right posterior cingulate, and left middle occipital gyri. Though these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of studies and the disparate methodologies used, this paper is an effort to synthesize across studies and to guide future exploration of neuroimaging and reading intervention.},

The broad ASD diagnosis used in the last decades and the resulting changes in the prevalence of these disorders have led to a relevant increase in the number of children diagnosed with ASD in the school system. The purpose of this review is to identify the different profiles of reading abilities shown by children with ASD described in the recent literature and the results of reported intervention methods.
METHODS: A review of the literature was conducted in the Web of Sciences and PubMed databases with the keywords 'autism' AND 'read*' and the filter 2010-2015. All articles published in the last 5 years focusing on description of and intervention for reading abilities in individuals with ASD were included. Review articles were excluded.
RESULTS: The selected 58 articles were divided into those that described reading abilities in individuals with ASD (n = 27) and those that reported intervention procedures for reading development (n = 31).
CONCLUSIONS: Direct comparisons and associations were prevented due to different inclusion criteria and lack of detailed information about intervention processes. We propose tentative conclusions that should be confirmed by further studies.},

Suspense appears to build on basic aspects of human cognition such as processes of expectation, anticipation, and prediction. However, the neural processes underlying emotional experiences of suspense have not been previously investigated. We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while participants read a suspenseful literary text (E.T.A. Hoffmann's "The Sandman") subdivided into short text passages. Individual ratings of experienced suspense obtained after each text passage were found to be related to activation in the medial frontal cortex, bilateral frontal regions (along the inferior frontal sulcus), lateral premotor cortex, as well as posterior temporal and temporo-parietal areas. The results indicate that the emotional experience of suspense depends on brain areas associated with social cognition and predictive inference.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children with ASD show a unique reading profile characterized by decoding abilities equivalent to verbal abilities, but with lower comprehension skills. Neuroimaging studies have found recruitment of regions primarily associated with visual processing (e.g., fusiform gyrus and medial parietal cortex), but reduced activation in frontal and temporal regions, when reading in adults with ASD. The purpose of this study was to assess neural changes associated with an intense reading intervention program in children with ASD using three fMRI tasks of reading.
METHODS: 25 children with ASD were randomly assigned to a treatment (ASD-EXP) or waitlist group (ASD-WLC). Children participated in a reading intervention program (4-hour sessions per day, 5 days a week for 10 weeks). We utilized three tasks: word, sentence, and multisentence processing, each with differential demands of reading comprehension. fMRI data were acquired at each of two scanning sessions 10-weeks apart.
RESULTS: Across tasks, post-intervention results revealed that the ASD-EXP group showed greater activation in bilateral precentral gyrus and the postcentral gyrus, visual processing regions (e.g., occipital cortex, fusiform gyrus), and frontal regions. In the word task, left thalamus and the right angular gyrus (AG) activation was unique to the ASD-EXP group post-intervention. Sentence tasks showed differential activation of core language areas (e.g., IFG, IPL) post-intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence for differential recruitment of brain regions based on task demands in children with ASD, and support the potential of targeted interventions to alter brain activation in response to positive gains in treatment. Children with ASD have a different reading profile from other reading disorders that needs to be specifically targeted in interventions.},

Fifteen articles were evaluated by the type of reading intervention, associations between positive reading effects and behavioral/social skill outcomes, and The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) determinants of study ratings. Findings suggested that reading interventions tended to have positive reading outcomes, while behavioral/social skill outcomes were small or negative. Research did not suggest an association between improved reading and behavioral performance, regardless of the WWC study determinants rating. Implications include reading instruction may not be sufficient to improve behavioral and social skill outcomes.

	abstract = {Attempts to characterize the neural differences between individuals with and without dyslexia generally point to reduced activation in and connectivity between brain areas in a reading network composed of the inferior frontal gyrus, the ventral occipito-temporal cortex, and the dorsal temporo-parietal circuit. However, developmental work on brain activity during reading has indicated that some brain areas show developmental decreases in activation with age. Thus, reading network connectivity may also show decreases that are positively associated with increases in reading ability. However, the developmental trajectory of reading network connectivity in typically developing readers is not yet well established. In the current study, we use a longitudinal design to determine how connectivity changes over time, and how these changes relate to changes in reading skill. We find that longitudinal increases in reading ability are associated with higher initial connectivity in the dorsal stream between fusiform and inferior parietal cortex, implicated in phonological decoding, followed by decreases in connectivity in this stream over time. We further find that increases in reading ability are supported by maintenance of connectivity in the ventral stream between inferior occipital and fusiform cortex, suggesting a more mature automatic orthographic recognition strategy. Readers who show little reading improvement over time do not attain high levels of connectivity in the dorsal stream at any time point, and their ventral stream connectivity decreases over time. These results together suggest that superior reading ability is initially supported by phonological decoding, with a decreased reliance on this strategy as reading becomes more automated. Our results indicate that development of the dorsal and ventral streams are closely linked, and support the hypothesis that a decrease in the dorsal stream is important for ventral stream development.},

	abstract = {Depression and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are highly comorbid disorders that carry a large public health burden. However, there is a clear lack of knowledge of the neural pathological pathways underlying these illnesses. The present study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which a diet rich in fat can cause multiple complications in the brain, thereby affecting intracellular signaling and gene expression that underlie anxiety and depressive behaviors. The results show that a high-fat diet (HFD; {\textasciitilde}16 weeks) causes anxiety and anhedonic behaviors. Importantly, the results also show that 4 months of HFD causes disruption of intracellular cascades involved in synaptic plasticity and insulin signaling/glucose homeostasis (ie, Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), P70S6K), as well as increased corticosterone levels and activation of the innate immune system, including elevation of inflammatory cytokines (ie, IL-6, IL-1β, TNFα). Interestingly, the rapid acting antidepressant ketamine reverses the behavioral deficits caused by HFD and activates ERK and P70S6 kinase signaling in the prefrontal cortex. In addition, we found that pharmacological blockade of the innate immune inflammasome system by repeated administration of an inhibitor of the purinergic P2X7 receptor blocks the anxiety caused by HFD. Together these studies further elucidate the signaling pathways that underlie chronic HFD exposure on anxiety and depressive behaviors, and identify novel therapeutic targets for patients with metabolic disorder or T2D who suffer from anxiety and depression.},

	abstract = {Obesity is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular health problems including diabetes, hypertension, and stroke. These cardiovascular afflictions increase risk for cognitive decline and dementia, but it is unknown whether these factors, specifically obesity and Type II diabetes, are associated with specific patterns of brain atrophy. We used tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to examine gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume differences in 94 elderly subjects who remained cognitively normal for at least 5 years after their scan. Bivariate analyses with corrections for multiple comparisons strongly linked body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma insulin (FPI) levels, and Type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) with atrophy in frontal, temporal, and subcortical brain regions. A multiple regression model, also correcting for multiple comparisons, revealed that BMI was still negatively correlated with brain atrophy (FDR {\textless}5\%), while DM2 and FPI were no longer associated with any volume differences. In an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model controlling for age, gender, and race, obese subjects with a high BMI (BMI {\textgreater} 30) showed atrophy in the frontal lobes, anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and thalamus compared with individuals with a normal BMI (18.5-25). Overweight subjects (BMI: 25-30) had atrophy in the basal ganglia and corona radiata of the WM. Overall brain volume did not differ between overweight and obese persons. Higher BMI was associated with lower brain volumes in overweight and obese elderly subjects. Obesity is therefore associated with detectable brain volume deficits in cognitively normal elderly subjects.},

	abstract = {The association of Helicobacter pylori infection and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently been addressed, but no relative data exist regarding mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal phase of AD. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate H. pylori infection, by histology in a Greek MCI cohort. Sixty-three consecutive patients with amnestic MCI and 35 normal controls underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, histologic and serological examinations. The prevalence of H. pylori infection was 88.9\% (56/63) in MCI patients and 48.6\% (17/35) in anaemic controls, as confirmed by biopsy (P {\textless} 0.001, odds ratio: 8.47, 95\% CI: 3.03-23.67). Mean serum anti-H. pylori IgG concentration and plasma total homocysteine (Hcy) titre were higher in MCI patients than controls (74.86 +/- 57.22 vs. 17.37 +/- 9.30 U/ml; and 16.03 +/- 4.28 vs. 13.5 +/- 1.20 micromol/l; P {\textless} 0.001 and P = 0.015, respectively). When compared with the anaemic participants, MCI patients exhibited more often multifocal (body and antral) gastritis (92.1\% vs. 68.6\%; P = 0.03); in H. pylori positive MCI patients cognitive state correlated with serum anti-H. pylori IgG concentration. In conclusion, H. pylori prevalence was significantly higher in MCI patients than controls. This infection might contribute, at least in part, to the pathophysiology of MCI, possibly through induction of chronic atrophic gastritis and elevated Hcy consequences.},

Moreover, we postulated that H. pylori-related ROS might also be involved in the pathogenesis of extragastric common malignancies, thereby suggesting that H. pylori eradication might inhibit the development or delay the progression of aforementioned diseases.

The metabolic dysfunction, dyslipidaemia, and inflammation caused by obesity contribute to the development of a wide variety of disorders and effects on the nervous system. In the CNS, mild cognitive impairment can be attributed to obesity-induced alterations in hippocampal structure and function in some patients. Likewise, compromised hypothalamic function and subsequent defects in maintaining whole-body energy balance might be early events that contribute to weight gain and obesity development. In the peripheral nervous system, obesity-driven alterations in the autonomic nervous system prompt imbalances in sympathetic-parasympathetic activity, while alterations in the sensory-somatic nervous system underlie peripheral polyneuropathy, a common complication of diabetes. Pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery are promising interventions for people with obesity that can improve neurological function.

	doi = {10.1186/s12871-017-0361-z},
	abstract = {Background
Postoperative respiratory complications (PRCs) are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), often undiagnosed in the surgical population, may be a contributing factor. Thus, we aimed to develop and validate a score for preoperative prediction of OSA (SPOSA) based on data available in electronic medical records preoperatively.

Methods
OSA was defined as the occurrence of an OSA diagnostic code preceded by a polysomnography procedure. A priori defined variables were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression analysis to develop our score. Score validity was assessed by investigating the score’s ability to predict non-invasive ventilation. We then assessed the effect of high OSA risk, as defined by SPOSA, on PRCs within seven postoperative days and in-hospital mortality.

Results
A total of 108,781 surgical patients at Partners HealthCare hospitals (2007–2014) were studied. Predictors of OSA included BMI {\textgreater}25 kg*m−2 and comorbidities, including pulmonary hypertension, hypertension, and diabetes. The score yielded an area under the curve of 0.82. Non-invasive ventilation was significantly associated with high OSA risk (OR 1.44, 95\% CI 1.22–1.69). Using a dichotomized endpoint, 26,968 (24.8\%) patients were identified as high risk for OSA and 7.9\% of these patients experienced PRCs. OSA risk was significantly associated with PRCs (OR 1.30, 95\% CI 1.19–1.43).

Conclusion
SPOSA identifies patients at high risk for OSA using electronic medical record-derived data. High risk of OSA is associated with the occurrence of PRCs.

Here, we identified lnc-DC, which was exclusively expressed in human conventional dendritic cells (DCs). Knockdown of lnc-DC impaired DC differentiation from human monocytes in vitro and from mouse bone marrow cells in vivo and reduced capacity of DCs to stimulate T cell activation. lnc-DC mediated these effects by activating the transcription factor STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). lnc-DC bound directly to STAT3 in the cytoplasm, which promoted STAT3 phosphorylation on tyrosine-705 by preventing STAT3 binding to and dephosphorylation by SHP1. Our work identifies a lncRNA that regulates DC differentiation and also broadens the known mechanisms of lncRNA action.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of composite outcomes have been developed to capture the perspective of the patient, clinician and objective measures of health in assessing heart failure outcomes. To date there has been a limited examination in the composition of these outcomes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Three commonly used scoring systems in heart failure trials: Packer's composite, Patient Journey and the African American Heart Failure Trial (A-HeFT) scores were compared in assessing outcomes from the Which heart failure intervention is most cost-effective \& consumer friendly in reducing hospital care (WHICH(?)) Trial. Comparability and interpretability of these outcomes and the influence of each component to the final outcome were examined. Despite all three composite outcomes incorporating mortality, hospitalisation and quality of life (QoL), the contribution of each individual component to the final outcomes differed. The component with the most influence in deteriorating condition for the Packer's composite was hospitalisation (67.7\%), while in Patient Journey it was QoL (61.5\%) and for A-HeFT composite score it was mortality (45.4\%).
CONCLUSIONS: The contribution made by each component varied in subtle, but important ways. This study emphasises the importance of understanding the value system of the composite outcomes to enable meaningful interpretation of results.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients have a unique role in deciding what treatments should be available for them and regulatory agencies should take their preferences into account when making treatment approval decisions. This is the first study designed to obtain quantitative patient-preference evidence to inform regulatory approval decisions by the Food and Drug Administration Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
METHODS: Five-hundred and forty United States adults with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m(2) evaluated tradeoffs among effectiveness, safety, and other attributes of weight-loss devices in a scientific survey. Discrete-choice experiments were used to quantify the importance of safety, effectiveness, and other attributes of weight-loss devices to obese respondents. A tool based on these measures is being used to inform benefit-risk assessments for premarket approval of medical devices.
RESULTS: Respondent choices yielded preference scores indicating their relative value for attributes of weight-loss devices in this study. We developed a tool to estimate the minimum weight loss acceptable by a patient to receive a device with a given risk profile and the maximum mortality risk tolerable in exchange for a given weight loss. For example, to accept a device with 0.01 \% mortality risk, a risk tolerant patient will require about 10 \% total body weight loss lasting 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient preference evidence was used make regulatory decision making more patient-centered. In addition, we captured the heterogeneity of patient preferences allowing market approval of effective devices for risk tolerant patients. CDRH is using the study tool to define minimum clinical effectiveness to evaluate new weight-loss devices. The methods presented can be applied to a wide variety of medical products. This study supports the ongoing development of a guidance document on incorporating patient preferences into medical-device premarket approval decisions.},

	abstract = {Importance: The role of coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing for guiding preventive strategies among women at low cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk based on the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association CVD prevention guidelines is unclear.
Objective: To assess the potential utility of CAC testing for CVD risk estimation and stratification among low-risk women.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Women with 10-year atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk lower than 7.5\% from 5 large population-based cohorts: the Dallas Heart Study (United States), the Framingham Heart Study (United States), the Heinz Nixdorf Recall study (Germany), the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (United States), and the Rotterdam Study (the Netherlands). The 5 cohorts were selected based on the availability of CAC data in a sizable group of low-risk women from the general population together with the long detailed follow-up data. Across the cohorts, events were assessed from the date of CAC scan (performed from 1998 through 2006) until January 1, 2012; January 1, 2014; or March 6, 2015. Fixed-effects meta-analysis was conducted to combine the results of the 5 studies.
Exposures: CAC score by computed tomography.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcome was incident ASCVD, including nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease (CHD) death, and stroke. Association of CAC with ASCVD was examined using Cox proportional hazards models. To assess whether CAC was associated with improved ASCVD risk predictions beyond the traditional risk factors, the C statistic and the continuous net reclassification improvement (cNRI) index were calculated.
Results: Among 6739 women with low ASCVD risk from the 5 studies, mean age ranged from 44 to 63 years and CAC was present in 36.1\%. Across the cohorts, median follow-up ranged from 7.0 to 11.6 years. A total of 165 ASCVD events occurred (64 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 29 CHD deaths, and 72 strokes), with the ASCVD incidence rates ranging from 1.5 to 6.0 per 1000 person-years. Compared with the absence of CAC (CAC = 0), presence of CAC (CAC {\textgreater}0) was associated with an increased risk of ASCVD (incidence rates per 1000 person-years, 1.41 for CAC absence vs 4.33 for CAC presence; difference, 2.92 [95\% CI, 2.02-3.83]; multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 2.04 [95\% CI, 1.44-2.90]). The addition of CAC to traditional risk factors improved the C statistic from 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.69-0.77) to 0.77 (95\% CI, 0.74-0.81) and provided a cNRI of 0.20 (95\% CI, 0.09-0.31) for ASCVD prediction.
Conclusions and Relevance: Among women at low ASCVD risk, CAC was present in approximately one-third and was associated with an increased risk of ASCVD and modest improvement in prognostic accuracy compared with traditional risk factors. Further research is needed to assess the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of this additional accuracy.},

	doi = {10.1097/EDE.0000000000000018},
	abstract = {Net reclassification indices have recently become popular statistics for measuring the prediction increment of new biomarkers. We review the various types of net reclassification indices and their correct interpretations. We evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of quantifying the prediction increment with these indices. For predefined risk categories, we relate net reclassification indices to existing measures of the prediction increment. We also consider statistical methodology for constructing confidence intervals for net reclassification indices and evaluate the merits of hypothesis testing based on such indices. We recommend that investigators using net reclassification indices should report them separately for events (cases) and nonevents (controls). When there are two risk categories, the components of net reclassification indices are the same as the changes in the true- and false-positive rates. We advocate the use of true- and false-positive rates and suggest it is more useful for investigators to retain the existing, descriptive terms. When there are three or more risk categories, we recommend against net reclassification indices because they do not adequately account for clinically important differences in shifts among risk categories. The category-free net reclassification index is a new descriptive device designed to avoid predefined risk categories. However, it experiences many of the same problems as other measures such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. In addition, the category-free index can mislead investigators by overstating the incremental value of a biomarker, even in independent validation data. When investigators want to test a null hypothesis of no prediction increment, the well-established tests for coefficients in the regression model are superior to the net reclassification index. If investigators want to use net reclassification indices, confidence intervals should be calculated using bootstrap methods rather than published variance formulas. The preferred single-number summary of the prediction increment is the improvement in net benefit.},

Several measures based on the table have been proposed, including the reclassification calibration (RC) statistic, the net reclassification improvement (NRI), and the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), but the performance of these in practical settings has not been fully examined. We used simulations to estimate the type I error and power for these statistics in a number of scenarios, as well as the impact of the number and type of categories, when adding a new marker to an established or reference model. The type I error was found to be reasonable in most settings, and power was highest for the IDI, which was similar to the test of association. The relative power of the RC statistic, a test of calibration, and the NRI, a test of discrimination, varied depending on the model assumptions.

Standard methods, including statistical significance and c statistic are useful but not sufficient. Net reclassification improvement (NRI) offers a simple intuitive way of quantifying improvement offered by new markers and has been gaining popularity among researchers. However, several aspects of the NRI have not been studied in sufficient detail., In this paper we propose a prospective formulation for the NRI which offers immediate application to survival and competing risk data as well as allows for easy weighting with observed or perceived costs. We address the issue of the number and choice of categories and their impact on NRI. We contrast category-based NRI with one which is category-free and conclude that NRIs cannot be compared across studies unless they are defined in the same manner. We discuss the impact of differing event rates when models are applied to different samples or definitions of events and durations of follow-up vary between studies. We also show how NRI can be applied to case-control data. The concepts presented in the paper are illustrated in a Framingham Heart Study example., In conclusion, NRI can be readily calculated for survival, competing risk, and case-control data, is more objective and comparable across studies using the category-free version, and can include relative costs for classifications. We recommend that researchers clearly define and justify the choices they make when choosing NRI for their application.},

	abstract = {The integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) index is a popular tool for evaluating the capacity of a marker to predict a binary outcome of interest. Recent reports have proposed that the IDI is more sensitive than other metrics for identifying useful predictive markers. In this article, the authors use simulated data sets and theoretical analysis to investigate the statistical properties of the IDI. The authors consider the common situation in which a risk model is fitted to a data set with and without the new, candidate predictor(s). Results demonstrate that the published method of estimating the standard error of an IDI estimate tends to underestimate the error. The z test proposed in the literature for IDI-based testing of a new biomarker is not valid, because the null distribution of the test statistic is not standard normal, even in large samples. If a test for the incremental value of a marker is desired, the authors recommend the test based on the model. For investigators who find the IDI to be a useful measure, bootstrap methods may offer a reasonable option for inference when evaluating new predictors, as long as the added predictive capacity is large.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: From 13 routinely available patient characteristics, the Meta-analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC) constructed a risk score for prediction of mortality in heart failure. We included 51 043 patients from the national Swedish Heart Failure Registry and calculated the MAGGIC risk score for each patient. The outcome measure was 3-year mortality. The predicted probability of death obtained from the calculated risk score was compared with the observed 3-year mortality, and model discrimination and calibration were assessed by formal tests and graphical means. The overall 3-year mortality in the study population was 39.4\% and the MAGGIC project heart failure risk score predicted mortality was 36.4\% (observed to expected ratio: 1.08). Discrimination was excellent overall (C index = 0.741). The difference between the model-predicted and the observed 3-year mortality in the six risk groups varied between 5\% and -12\%.

CONCLUSION: The MAGGIC project heart failure risk score demonstrated an excellent ability to categorize patients in separate risk strata.

	abstract = {The Net Reclassification Index (NRI) is a very popular measure for evaluating the improvement in prediction performance gained by adding a marker to a set of baseline predictors. However, the statistical properties of this novel measure have not been explored in depth. We demonstrate the alarming result that the NRI statistic calculated on a large test dataset using risk models derived from a training set is likely to be positive even when the new marker has no predictive information. A related theoretical example is provided in which an incorrect risk function that includes an uninformative marker is proven to erroneously yield a positive NRI. Some insight into this phenomenon is provided. Since large values for the NRI statistic may simply be due to use of poorly fitting risk models, we suggest caution in using the NRI as the basis for marker evaluation. Other measures of prediction performance improvement, such as measures derived from the receiver operating characteristic curve, the net benefit function, and the Brier score, cannot be large due to poorly fitting risk functions.},

	doi = {10.1111/ene.12608},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are associated with an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. The impact of oral anticoagulation (OAC) on CMBs is not well characterized. Our aim was to assess the prevalence of CMBs in stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and to analyze the implications of previous treatment with OAC.
METHODS: In this retrospective analysis on data from a prospectively recruiting stroke registry, patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA with brain magnetic resonance imaging including susceptibility weighted imaging were consecutively enrolled during a 3-year period. For each patient cardiovascular risk factors, AF history and recent diagnosis of AF, present use of OAC and antiplatelets, the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale and the premorbid modified Rankin Scale score were recorded. Two independent raters identified CMBs according to consensus criteria. CMB location was classified as lobar, deep or in the posterior fossa.
RESULTS: In all, 785 patients (mean age 63.9 ± 14.2 years) were included. At least one CMB was detected in 186 (23.7\%) patients. CMBs were significantly more frequent in patients with AF (30.5\% vs. 22.4\%). Patients with previous OAC treatment were more likely to have CMBs (36.7\% vs. 22.8\%, P = 0.03) and abundant CMBs (n {\textgreater} 10) were more frequent in anticoagulated patients even after adjustment for age. However, age was the only independent factor predicting CMBs (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral microbleeds are common in elderly AF patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Previous OAC is associated with a higher number of CMBs predominantly in the lobar location. Establishing a causal relationship requires prospective longitudinal investigation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cerebral microbleeds are known to be indicative of bleeding-prone microangiopathy and may predict incident intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In this study, we investigated whether microbleeds are associated with the incidence of warfarin-related ICH.
METHODS: Twenty-four patients with ICH while on outpatient treatment with warfarin were selected from a consecutive cohort. Control, warfarin-using subjects with no history of ICH were randomly selected during the same time period (n = 48). We compared demographic factors, vascular risk factors, laboratory findings, and radiologic findings including microbleeds between the groups.
RESULT: There were more cases of patients with microbleeds in the ICH than control group (79.2\% vs 22.9\%: p {\textless} 0.001), and the number of microbleeds was much higher for the ICH group (9.0 +/- 26.8 vs 0.5 +/- 1.03: p {\textless} 0.001). Moreover, the number of microbleeds was significantly correlated with the presence of warfarin-related ICH (r = 0.299; p {\textless} 0.001). Conditional logistic regression analysis showed that increased prothrombin time and the presence of microbleeds were independently related to the incidence of warfarin-related ICH (microbleeds: adjusted OR, 83.12).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that underlying microbleeds are independently associated with an incidence of warfarin-related intracerebral hemorrhage. Future research should focus on elucidating the risks and benefits of warfarin medication in patients with microbleeds.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose— Cerebral microbleeds (MB) are potential risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but it is unclear if they are a contraindication to using antithrombotic drugs. Insights could be gained by pooling data on MB frequency stratified by antithrombotic use in cohorts with ICH and ischemic stroke (IS)/transient ischemic attack (TIA).
Methods— We performed a systematic review of published and unpublished data from cohorts with stroke or TIA to compare the presence of MB in: (1) antithrombotic users vs nonantithrombotic users with ICH; (2) antithrombotic users vs nonusers with IS/TIA; and (3) ICH vs ischemic events stratified by antithrombotic use. We also analyzed published and unpublished follow-up data to determine the risk of ICH in antithrombotic users with MB.
Results— In a pooled analysis of 1460 ICH and 3817 IS/TIA, MB were more frequent in ICH vs IS/TIA in all treatment groups, but the excess increased from 2.8 (odds ratio; range, 2.3–3.5) in nonantithrombotic users to 5.7 (range, 3.4–9.7) in antiplatelet users and 8.0 (range, 3.5–17.8) in warfarin users (P difference=0.01). There was also an excess of MB in warfarin users vs nonusers with ICH (OR, 2.7; 95\% CI, 1.6–4.4; P{\textless}0.001) but none in warfarin users with IS/TIA (OR, 1.3; 95\% CI, 0.9–1.7; P=0.33; P difference=0.01). There was a smaller excess of MB in antiplatelet users vs nonusers with ICH (OR, 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.3–2.3; P{\textless}0.001), but findings were similar for antiplatelet users with IS/TIA (OR, 1.4; 95\% CI, 1.2–1.7; P{\textless}0.001; P difference=0.25). In pooled follow-up data for 768 antithrombotic users, presence of MB at baseline was associated with a substantially increased risk of subsequent ICH (OR, 12.1; 95\% CI, 3.4–42.5; P{\textless}0.001).
Conclusions— The excess of MB in warfarin users with ICH compared to other groups suggests that MB increase the risk of warfarin-associated ICH. Limited prospective data corroborate these findings, but larger prospective studies are urgently required.},

The best approach to assess patient prognosis relies on prediction models that simultaneously consider a number of prognostic factors and provide an estimate of patients’ absolute risk of an event. Such prediction models should be characterized by adequately discriminating between patients who will have an event and those who will not and by adequate calibration ensuring accurate prediction of absolute risk. This Users’ Guide will help clinicians understand the available metrics for assessing discrimination, calibration, and the relative performance of different prediction models. This article complements existing Users’ Guides that address the development and validation of prediction models.

We did TDP-43 immunohistochemistry and classified individuals as follows: no TDP-43 in the amygdala or hippocampus; TDP-43 restricted to the amygdala; and TDP-43 spreading into the hippocampus. Each individual was also assigned a neurofibrillary tangle stage (B1–B3), relating to the likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease. We used longitudinal FreeSurfer software and tensor-based morphometry with symmetric normalisation to calculate hippocampal volume on all serial MRI scans and used linear mixed-effects regression models to estimate associations between TDP-43 and rate of hippocampal atrophy and to assess the trajectory of TDP-43-associated atrophy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We identified 298 individuals meeting the inclusion criteria, with 816 usable MRI scans (spanning 1·0–11·2 years of the disease) available for analysis. 141 individuals showed no TDP-43 in the amygdala or hippocampus, 33 had TDP-43 restricted to the amygdala, and 124 had TDP-43 in the hippocampus. Among individuals with a high likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease (neurofibrillary tangle stage B3; n=205), those with hippocampal TDP-43 had faster rates of hippocampal atrophy (n=103, annual volume change −4·39\%, 95\% CI −4·82 to −3·95; p{\textless}0·0001) than did those with amygdala-only TDP-43 (n=20, −3·29\%, −4·11 to −2·46; p{\textless}0·0001; difference −1·10\%, 95\% CI −2·02 to −0·19; p=0·02) and those without TDP-43 (n=82, −3·11\%, −3·54 to −2·68; p{\textless}0·0001; difference −1·28\%, −1·88 to −0·67; p{\textless}0·0001). Among individuals with an intermediate likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease (neurofibrillary tangle stage B2; n=56), those with hippocampal TDP-43 had faster rates of hippocampal atrophy (n=17, annual volume change −4·05\%, 95\% CI −5·09 to −2·99; p{\textless}0·0001) than did those with amygdala-only TDP-43 (n=6, −1·78\%, −3·04 to −0·55; p=0·004; difference −2·27\%, 95\% CI −3·79 to −0·67; p=0·006) and those without TDP-43 (n=33, −1·63\%, −2·43 to −0·83; p=0·0002; difference −2·43\%, −3·66 to −1·18; p=0·0002). Hippocampal TDP-43 was not associated with the rate of hippocampal atrophy in individuals with a low likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease (neurofibrillary tangle stage B1; n=37). The trajectory analysis suggested that increased rates of TDP-43-associated hippocampal atrophy might occur at least 10 years before death.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-Sequencing data are used widely for research. TCGA provides 'Level 3' data, which have been processed using a pipeline specific to that resource. However, we have found using experimentally derived data that this pipeline produces gene-expression values that vary considerably across biological replicates. In addition, some RNA-Sequencing analysis tools require integer-based read counts, which are not provided with the Level 3 data. As an alternative, we have reprocessed the data for 9264 tumor and 741 normal samples across 24 cancer types using the Rsubread package. We have also collated corresponding clinical data for these samples. We provide these data as a community resource. RESULTS: We compared TCGA samples processed using either pipeline and found that the Rsubread pipeline produced fewer zero-expression genes and more consistent expression levels across replicate samples than the TCGA pipeline. Additionally, we used a genomic-signature approach to estimate HER2 (ERBB2) activation status for 662 breast-tumor samples and found that the Rsubread data resulted in stronger predictions of HER2 pathway activity. Finally, we used data from both pipelines to classify 575 lung cancer samples based on histological type. This analysis identified various non-coding RNA that may influence lung-cancer histology. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The RNA-Sequencing and clinical data can be downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE62944).

As we discuss in this Personal Perspective, we believe that context and various changes in plasticity biomarkers can help identify at least three types of EMT and that using a collection of criteria for EMT increases the likelihood that everyone is studying the same phenomenon - namely, the transition of epithelial and endothelial cells to a motile phenotype.},

We find that uniform alignment and quantification is not sufficient when combining RNA-seq data from different sources and that the removal of other batch effects is essential to facilitate data comparison.

Despite the clinical importance of discrimination, reliable diagnostic biomarkers are still lacking. Here, we have characterised a cohort of squamous cell lung (SQCLC) and head‐and‐neck (HNSCC) carcinomas by quantitative proteomics. In a training cohort, we quantified 4,957 proteins in 44 SQCLC and 30 HNSCC tumours. A total of 518 proteins were found to be differentially expressed between SQCLC and HNSCC, and some of these were identified as genetic dependencies in either of the two tumour types. Using supervised machine learning, we inferred a proteomic signature for the classification of squamous cell carcinomas as either SQCLC or HNSCC, with diagnostic accuracies of 90.5\% and 86.8\% in cross‐ and independent validations, respectively. Furthermore, application of this signature to a cohort of pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas of unknown origin leads to a significant prognostic separation. This study not only provides a diagnostic proteomic signature for classification of secondary lung tumours in HNSCC patients, but also represents a proteomic resource for HNSCC and SQCLC.

Differentiation between head‐and‐neck cancer metastasis and primary lung cancer is clinically important for therapy selection. A novel diagnostic proteomic signature allows differentiation between these tumour types, and a proteomic resource for squamous cell tumours is here provided.

The protein expression profiles of 63 squamous cell lung and 49 head‐and‐neck tumours were analysed by quantitative mass spectrometry yielding a proteomic resource covering 6,214 quantified proteins.518 proteins were found to be differentially expressed between squamous cell lung and head‐and‐neck cancers which are known to share genomic and morphological features.A diagnostic proteomic signature for differentiation between primary squamous cell lung cancers and head‐and‐neck cancer metastases was identified by quantitative mass‐spectrometry‐based proteomics and validated in independent patient cohorts.},

	abstract = {Summary
The lung presents a highly oxidative environment, which is tolerated through engagement of tightly controlled stress response pathways. A critical stress response mediator is the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2/NRF2), which is negatively regulated by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). Alterations in the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway have been identified in 23\% of lung adenocarcinomas, suggesting that deregulation of the pathway is a major cancer driver. We demonstrate that inactivation of Keap1 and Pten in the mouse lung promotes adenocarcinoma formation. Notably, metabolites identified in the plasma of Keap1f/f/Ptenf/f tumor-bearing mice indicate that tumorigenesis is associated with reprogramming of the pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, the immune milieu was dramatically changed by Keap1 and Pten deletion, and tumor regression was achieved utilizing immune checkpoint inhibition. Thus, our study highlights the ability to exploit both metabolic and immune characteristics in the detection and treatment of lung tumors harboring KEAP1/NRF2 pathway alterations.},

	abstract = {Chromatin modifying enzymes are frequently mutated in cancer, resulting in widespread epigenetic deregulation. Recent reports indicate that inactivating mutations in the histone methyltransferase NSD1 define an intrinsic subtype of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) that features pronounced DNA hypomethylation. Here, we describe a similar hypomethylated subtype of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) that is enriched for both inactivating mutations and deletions in NSD1. The ‘NSD1 subtypes’ of HNSC and LUSC are highly correlated at the DNA methylation and gene expression levels, featuring ectopic expression of developmental transcription factors and genes that are also hypomethylated in Sotos syndrome, a congenital disorder caused by germline NSD1 mutations. Further, the NSD1 subtype of HNSC displays an ‘immune cold’ phenotype characterized by low infiltration of tumor-associated leukocytes, particularly macrophages and CD8+ T cells, as well as low expression of genes encoding the immunotherapy target PD-1 immune checkpoint receptor and its ligands. Using an in vivo model, we demonstrate that NSD1 inactivation results in reduced T cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, implicating NSD1 as a tumor cell-intrinsic driver of an immune cold phenotype. NSD1 inactivation therefore causes epigenetic deregulation across cancer sites, and has implications for immunotherapy.},

However, the signals responsible for upregulation of PD-L1 in NSCLC cells and whether they are integrated with the regulation of other immune-related genes are not known. Mucin 1 (MUC1) is aberrantly overexpressed in NSCLC, activates the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65ZEB1 pathway and confers a poor prognosis. The present studies demonstrate that MUC1-C activates PD-L1 expression in NSCLC cells. We show that MUC1-C increases NF-κB p65 occupancy on the CD274/PD-L1 promoter and thereby drives CD274 transcription. Moreover, we demonstrate that MUC1-C-induced activation of NF-κBZEB1 signaling represses the TLR9 (toll-like receptor 9), IFNG, MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and GM-CSF genes, and that this signature is associated with decreases in overall survival. In concert with these results, targeting MUC1-C in NSCLC tumors suppresses PD-L1 and induces these effectors of innate and adaptive immunity. These findings support a previously unrecognized central role for MUC1-C in integrating PD-L1 activation with suppression of immune effectors and poor clinical outcome.},

However, the role of PTEN promoter methylation in melanoma is not well understood. We thus sought to elucidate the prevalence of PTEN promoter methylation in melanoma specimens, its relationship to clinical features, and its impact on the outcome of patients with melanoma. PTEN promoter methylation data were acquired from an archived primary Korean melanoma cohort (KMC) of 158 patients and, for validation, 234 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas melanoma (TCGA-MEL) cohort. Hierarchical clustering was performed to identify PTEN “high methylated” and “low methylated” samples. Subsequently, differences in clinical features and outcomes based on PTEN promoter methylation status were then analyzed using SPSS and R. In the KMC, all tumors were acquired from primary tumors and 65.7\% (n = 105) were acral or mucosal by site, whereas in the TCGA-MEL cohort, 90.5\% of the tumors were from regional lymph node and distant metastatic lesions. Overall, 17.7\% and 45.7\% of the specimens harbored BRAF mutations in the KMC and TCGA-MEL cohort, respectively. Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog was mutated in 12.2\% and 26.9\% of the tumors in the KMC and TCGA-MEL cohort, respectively. In the KMC, 31 cases (19.6\%) were included in the high methylated group versus 142 cases (60.7\%) in the TCGA-MEL cohort (P {\textless} 0.001). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed promoter methylation of PTEN to be an independent negative prognostic factor for survival in both the KMC (hazard ratio 3.76, 95\% confidence interval = 1.24–11.12, P = 0.017) and TCGA-MEL cohort (HR 1.88, 95\% confidence interval = 1.13–3.12, P = 0.015).

A subset of HPV negative HNSCCs occur in patients without smoking history, however, and these etiologically ‘atypical’ HNSCCs disproportionately occur in the oral cavity, and in female patients, suggesting a distinct etiology. To investigate the determinants of clinical and molecular heterogeneity, we performed unsupervised clustering to classify 528 HNSCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) into putative intrinsic subtypes based on their profiles of epigenetically (DNA methylation) deregulated genes. HNSCCs clustered into five subtypes, including one HPV positive subtype, two smoking-related subtypes, and two atypical subtypes. One atypical subtype was particularly genomically stable, but featured widespread gene silencing associated with the ‘CpG island methylator phenotype’ (CIMP). Further distinguishing features of this ‘CIMP-Atypical’ subtype include an antiviral gene expression profile associated with pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and CD8+ T cell infiltration, CASP8 mutations, and a well-differentiated state corresponding to normal SOX2 copy number and SOX2OT hypermethylation. We developed a gene expression classifier for the CIMP-Atypical subtype that could classify atypical disease features in two independent patient cohorts, demonstrating the reproducibility of this subtype. Taken together, these findings provide unprecedented evidence that atypical HNSCC is molecularly distinct, and postulates the CIMP-Atypical subtype as a distinct clinical entity that may be caused by chronic inflammation.},

After cellular uptake, Ara-C is converted into its therapeutically active triphosphate metabolite, Ara-CTP, which exerts antileukemic effects, primarily by inhibiting DNA synthesis in proliferating cells1. Currently, a substantial fraction of patients with AML fail to respond effectively to Ara-C therapy, and reliable biomarkers for predicting the therapeutic response to Ara-C are lacking2,3. SAMHD1 is a deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) triphosphohydrolase that cleaves physiological dNTPs into deoxyribonucleosides and inorganic triphosphate4,5. Although it has been postulated that SAMHD1 sensitizes cancer cells to nucleoside-analog derivatives through the depletion of competing dNTPs6, we show here that SAMHD1 reduces Ara-C cytotoxicity in AML cells. Mechanistically, dGTP-activated SAMHD1 hydrolyzes Ara-CTP, which results in a drastic reduction of Ara-CTP in leukemic cells. Loss of SAMHD1 activity—through genetic depletion, mutational inactivation of its triphosphohydrolase activity or proteasomal degradation using specialized, virus-like particles7,8—potentiates the cytotoxicity of Ara-C in AML cells. In mouse models of retroviral AML transplantation, as well as in retrospective analyses of adult patients with AML, the response to Ara-C-containing therapy was inversely correlated with SAMHD1 expression. These results identify SAMHD1 as a potential biomarker for the stratification of patients with AML who might best respond to Ara-C-based therapy and as a target for treating Ara-C-refractory AML.},

	abstract = {Background
Large collections of paraffin-embedded tissue represent a rich resource to test hypotheses based on gene expression patterns; however, measurement of genome-wide expression is cost-prohibitive on a large scale. Using the known expression correlation structure within a given disease type (in this case, high grade serous ovarian cancer; HGSC), we sought to identify reduced sets of directly measured (DM) genes which could accurately predict the expression of a maximized number of unmeasured genes.

Results
We developed a greedy gene set selection (GGS) algorithm which returns a DM set of user specified size based on a specific correlation threshold ({\textbar}rP{\textbar}) and minimum number of DM genes that must be correlated to an unmeasured gene in order to infer the value of the unmeasured gene (redundancy). We evaluated GGS in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HGSC data across 144 combinations of DM size, redundancy (1–3), and {\textbar}rP{\textbar} (0.60, 0.65, 0.70). Across the parameter sweep, GGS allows on average 9 times more gene expression information to be captured compared to the DM set alone. GGS successfully augments prognostic HGSC gene sets; the addition of 20 GGS selected genes more than doubles the number of genes whose expression is predictable. Moreover, the expression prediction is highly accurate. After training regression models for the predictable gene set using 2/3 of the TCGA data, the average accuracy (ranked correlation of true and predicted values) in the 1/3 testing partition and four independent populations is above 0.65 and approaches 0.8 for conservative parameter sets. We observe similar accuracies in the TCGA HGSC RNA-sequencing data. Specifically, the prediction accuracy increases with increasing redundancy and increasing {\textbar}rP{\textbar}.

Conclusions
GGS-selected genes, which maximize expression information about unmeasured genes, can be combined with candidate gene sets as a cost effective way to increase the amount of gene expression information obtained in large studies. This method can be applied to any organism, model system, disease, or tissue type for which whole genome gene expression data exists.

	abstract = {Background
Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) plays an important role in cancer pathogenesis. In breast cancer, it reduces proliferation and increases migration in a cell line-dependent manner. To characterize the transcriptional mediators of these phenotypes, we performed RNA-seq and DNase-seq analyses after BMP4 treatment in MDA-MB-231 and T-47D breast cancer cells that respond to BMP4 with enhanced migration and decreased cell growth, respectively.

Results
The RNA-seq data revealed gene expression changes that were consistent with the in vitro phenotypes of the cell lines, particularly in MDA-MB-231, where migration-related processes were enriched. These results were confirmed when enrichment of BMP4-induced open chromatin regions was analyzed. Interestingly, the chromatin in transcription start sites of differentially expressed genes was already open in unstimulated cells, thus enabling rapid recruitment of transcription factors to the promoters as a response to stimulation. Further analysis and functional validation identified MBD2, CBFB, and HIF1A as downstream regulators of BMP4 signaling. Silencing of these transcription factors revealed that MBD2 was a consistent activator of target genes in both cell lines, CBFB an activator in cells with reduced proliferation phenotype, and HIF1A a repressor in cells with induced migration phenotype.

Conclusions
Integrating RNA-seq and DNase-seq data showed that the phenotypic responses to BMP4 in breast cancer cell lines are reflected in transcriptomic and chromatin levels. We identified and experimentally validated downstream regulators of BMP4 signaling that relate to the different in vitro phenotypes and thus demonstrate that the downstream BMP4 response is regulated in a cell type-specific manner.

	abstract = {Loss of epithelial differentiation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling are known to facilitate cancer progression and are associated with poor prognosis in patients with lung cancer. We have identified Receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 4 (RIP4) as a regulator of tumor differentiation in lung adenocarcinoma (AC). Bioinformatics analyses of human lung AC samples showed that poorly differentiated tumors express low levels of RIP4, whereas high levels are associated with better overall survival. In vitro, lung tumor cells expressing reduced RIP4 levels showed enhanced activation of STAT3 signaling and had a greater ability to invade through collagen. In contrast, overexpression of RIP4 inhibited STAT3 activation, which abrogated interleukin-6-dependent induction of lysyl oxidase, a collagen cross-linking enzyme. In an autochthonous mouse model of lung AC initiated by Kras(G12D) expression with loss of p53, Rip4 knockdown tumors progressed to a poorly differentiated state marked by an increase in Hmga2, reduced Ttf1, and enrichment of genes regulating extracellular remodeling and Jak-Stat signaling. Tail vein injections of cells overexpressing Rip4 showed a reduced potential to invade and form tumors, which was restored by co-expression of Stat3. Altogether, our work has identified that loss of RIP4 enhances STAT3 signaling in lung cancer cells, promoting the expression of ECM remodeling genes and cancer dedifferentiation.},

Various computational tools have been developed to aid researchers in carrying out specific TCGA data analyses; however there is need for resources to facilitate the study of gene expression variations and survival associations across tumors. Here, we report UALCAN, an easy to use, interactive web-portal to perform to in-depth analyses of TCGA gene expression data. UALCAN uses TCGA level 3 RNA-seq and clinical data from 31 cancer types. The portal's user-friendly features allow to perform: 1) analyze relative expression of a query gene(s) across tumor and normal samples, as well as in various tumor sub-groups based on individual cancer stages, tumor grade, race, body weight or other clinicopathologic features, 2) estimate the effect of gene expression level and clinicopathologic features on patient survival; and 3) identify the top over- and under-expressed (up and down-regulated) genes in individual cancer types. This resource serves as a platform for in silico validation of target genes and for identifying tumor sub-group specific candidate biomarkers.

Fresh frozen (FF) tissue specimens of GBM are difficult to obtain since tumor tissue obtained at surgery is often scarce and necrotic and diagnosis is prioritized over freezing. After diagnosis, leftover tissue is usually stored as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. However, RNA from FFPE tissues is usually degraded, which could hamper gene expression analysis. We compared RNA-Seq data obtained from matched pairs of FF and FFPE GBM specimens. Only three FFPE out of eleven FFPE-FF matched samples yielded informative results. Several quality-control measurements showed that RNA from FFPE samples was highly degraded but maintained transcriptomic similarities to RNA from FF samples. Certain issues regarding mutation analysis and subtype prediction were detected. Nevertheless, our results suggest that RNA-Seq of FFPE GBM specimens provides reliable gene expression data that can be used in molecular studies of GBM if the RNA is sufficiently preserved.},

In the present study, the clinicopathological features and immunohistochemical expression of the Skp2 protein were studied in 500 patients with NSCLC (351 with LUAD and 149 with LUSC). Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. Skp2 associated genes were identified based on the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Skp2 was overexpressed in patients with LUSC, compared with LUAD (P{\textless}0.001). In histology subgroup analysis, differences in Skp2 protein expression were observed in patients with LUAD, based on sex, differentiation, smoking history, stage, lymph node metastasis and tumor diameter (P{\textless}0.05), but not in patients with LUSC except for smoking status. High Skp2 protein expression in patients with LUAD was associated with reduced overall survival (OS; P{\textless}0.001), but not in patients with LUSC (P=0.686). The multivariate analysis demonstrated that Skp2 expression is an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for OS in patients with LUAD (RR=1.845, P{\textless}0.05). Bioinformatics analyses revealed that minichromosome maintenance complex component 2, cell division cycle 45, replication factor C subunit 4, which are differently expressed in LUAD and LUSC, are associated with Skp2 expression and participate in DNA replication and G1/S transition. Skp2 protein expression differs in LUAD and LUSC. The clinicopathological and prognostic implications based on Skp2 expression in LUAD and LUSC should be considered different.

A subset of HPV negative HNSCCs occur in patients without smoking history, however, and these etiologically ‘atypical’ HNSCCs disproportionately occur in the oral cavity, and in female patients, suggesting a distinct etiology., To investigate the determinants of clinical and molecular heterogeneity, we performed unsupervised clustering to classify 528 HNSCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) into putative intrinsic subtypes based on their profiles of epigenetically (DNA methylation) deregulated genes., HNSCCs clustered into five subtypes, including one HPV positive subtype, two smoking-related subtypes, and two atypical subtypes. One atypical subtype was particularly genomically stable, but featured widespread gene silencing associated with the ‘CpG island methylator phenotype’ (CIMP)., Further distinguishing features of this ‘CIMP-Atypical’ subtype include an antiviral gene expression profile associated with pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and CD8+ T cell infiltration, CASP8 mutations, and a well-differentiated state corresponding to normal SOX2 copy number and SOX2OT hypermethylation. We developed a gene expression classifier for the CIMP-Atypical subtype that could classify atypical disease features in two independent patient cohorts, demonstrating the reproducibility of this subtype.

An increasing number of precision oncology programmes are being launched world-wide. To support this development, we present the Cancer Variant Explorer (CVE), an R package with an interactive Shiny web browser interface.

Results
Leveraging Oncotator and the Drug Gene Interaction Database, CVE offers exploration of variants within single or multiple tumour exomes to identify drivers, resistance mechanisms and to assess druggability. We present example applications including the analysis of an individual patient and a cohort-wide study, and provide a first extension of CVE by adding a tumour-specific co-expression network.

Conclusions
The CVE package allows interactive variant prioritisation to expedite the analysis of cancer sequencing studies. Our framework also includes the prioritisation of druggable targets, allows exploratory analysis of tissue specific networks and is extendable for specific applications by virtue of its modular design. We encourage the use of CVE within translational research studies and molecular tumour boards. The CVE package is available via Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/CVE/).

Because APE1 is essential for cell viability, generation of APE1‐knockout cell lines and determining a comprehensive list of genes regulated by APE1 has not been possible. To circumvent this challenge, we utilized single‐cell RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in relation to APE1 protein levels within the cell. Using a straightforward yet novel statistical design, we identified 2837 genes whose expression is significantly changed following APE1 knockdown. Using this gene expression profile, we identified multiple new pathways not previously linked to APE1, including the EIF2 signaling and mechanistic target of Rapamycin pathways and a number of mitochondrial‐related pathways. We demonstrate that APE1 has an effect on modifying gene expression up to a threshold of APE1 expression, demonstrating that it is not necessary to completely knockout APE1 in cells to accurately study APE1 function. We validated the findings using a selection of the DEGs along with siRNA knockdown and qRT‐PCR. Testing additional patient‐derived pancreatic cancer cells reveals particular genes (ITGA1,TNFAIP2,COMMD7,RAB3D) that respond to APE1 knockdown similarly across all the cell lines. Furthermore, we verified that the redox function of APE1 was responsible for driving gene expression of mitochondrial genes such as PRDX5 and genes that are important for proliferation such as SIPA1 and RAB3D by treating with APE1 redox‐specific inhibitor, APX3330. Our study identifies several novel genes and pathways affected by APE1, as well as tumor subtype specificity. These findings will allow for hypothesis‐driven approaches to generate combination therapies using, for example, APE1 inhibitor APX3330 with other approved FDA drugs in an innovative manner for pancreatic and other cancer treatments.},

We predict a growing convergence between hiPSC and post-mortem studies as both approaches expand to larger cohort sizes.

	abstract = {Interactions between the inflammatory chemokine CCL20 and its receptor CCR6 have been implicated in promoting colon cancer; however, the mechanisms behind this effect are poorly understood. We have previously demonstrated that deficiency of CCR6 is associated with decreased tumor macrophage accumulation in a model of sporadic intestinal tumorigenesis. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of stromal CCR6 expression in a murine syngeneic transplantable colon cancer model. We show that deficiency of host CCR6 is associated with decreased growth of syngeneic CCR6-expressing colon cancers. Colon cancers adoptively transplanted into CCR6-deficient mice have decreased tumor-associated macrophages without alterations in the number of monocytes in blood or bone marrow. CCL20, the unique ligand for CCR6, promotes migration of monocytes in vitro and promotes accumulation of macrophages in vivo. Depletion of tumor-associated macrophages decreases the growth of tumors in the transplantable tumor model. Macrophages infiltrating the colon cancers in this model secrete the inflammatory mediators CCL2, IL-1α, IL-6 and TNFα. Ccl2, Il1α and Il6 are consequently downregulated in tumors from CCR6-deficient mice. CCL2, IL-1α and IL-6 also promote proliferation of colon cancer cells, linking the decreased macrophage migration into tumors mediated by CCL20–CCR6 interactions to the delay in tumor growth in CCR6-deficient hosts. The relevance of these findings in human colon cancer is demonstrated through correlation of CCR6 expression with that of the macrophage marker CD163 as well as that of CCL2, IL1α and TNFα. Our findings support the exploration of targeting the CCL20–CCR6 pathway for the treatment of colon cancer.},

	abstract = {Background
Tumor-infiltrating leukocytes can either limit cancer growth or facilitate its spread. Diagnostic strategies that comprehensively assess the functional complexity of tumor immune infiltrates could have wide-reaching clinical value. In previous work we identified distinct immune gene signatures in breast tumors that reflect the relative abundance of infiltrating immune cells and exhibited significant associations with patient outcomes. Here we hypothesized that immune gene signatures agnostic to tumor type can be identified by de novo discovery of gene clusters enriched for immunological functions and possessing internal correlation structure conserved across solid tumors from different anatomic sites.

Methods
We assembled microarray expression datasets encompassing 5,295 tumors of the breast, colon, lung, ovarian and prostate. Unsupervised clustering methods were used to determine number and composition of gene clusters within each dataset. Immune-enriched gene clusters (signatures) identified by gene ontology enrichment were analyzed for internal correlation structure and conservation across tumors then compared against expression profiles of: 1) flow-sorted leukocytes from peripheral blood and 2) {\textgreater}300 cancer cell lines from solid and hematologic cancers. Cox regression analysis was used to identify signatures with significant associations with clinical outcome.

Results
We identified nine distinct immune-enriched gene signatures conserved across all five tumor types. The signatures differentiated specific leukocyte lineages with moderate discernment overall, and naturally organized into six discrete groups indicative of admixed lineages. Moreover, seven of the signatures exhibit minimal and uncorrelated expression in cancer cell lines, suggesting that these signatures derive predominantly from infiltrating immune cells. All nine immune signatures achieved statistically significant associations with patient prognosis (p{\textless}0.05) in one or more tumor types with greatest significance observed in breast and skin cancers. Several signatures indicative of myeloid lineages exhibited poor outcome associations that were most apparent in brain and colon cancers.

Conclusions
These findings suggest that tumor infiltrating immune cells can be differentiated by immune-specific gene expression patterns that quantify the relative abundance of multiple immune infiltrates across a range of solid tumor types. That these markers of immune involvement are significantly associated with patient prognosis in diverse cancers suggests their clinical utility as pan-cancer markers of tumor behavior and immune responsiveness.

Here, we use orthogonal RNA-sequencing data to quantify mtDNA expression (mtRNA), and report analogously lower expression of mtRNA in tumors (relative to normal tissue) across a majority of cancer types. Several cancers exhibit a trio of mutually consistent evidence suggesting a drop in respiratory activity: depletion of mtDNA copy number, decreases in mtRNA levels, and decreases in expression of nuDNA-encoded respiratory proteins. Intriguingly, a minority of cancer types exhibit a drop in mtDNA expression but an increase in nuDNA expression of respiratory proteins, with unknown implications for respiratory activity.

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States with a five-year patient survival rate of only 6\%. Early detection and treatment of this disease is hampered due to lack of reliable diagnostic and prognostic markers. Recent studies have shown that dynamic changes in the global DNA methylation and gene expression patterns play key roles in the PC development; hence, provide valuable insights for better understanding the initiation and progression of PC. In the current study, we used DNA methylation, gene expression, copy number, mutational and clinical data from pancreatic patients. We independently investigated the DNA methylation and differential gene expression profiles between normal and tumor samples and correlated methylation levels with gene expression patterns. We observed a total of {\textasciitilde}23-thousand differentially methylated CpG sites (Δβ≥0.1) between normal and tumor samples, where majority of the CpG sites are hypermethylated in PC, and this phenomenon is more prominent in the 5′UTRs and promoter regions compared to the gene bodies. Differential methylation is observed in genes associated with the homeobox domain, cell division and differentiation, cytoskeleton, epigenetic regulation and development, pancreatic development and pancreatic signaling and pancreatic cancer core signaling pathways. Correlation analysis suggests that methylation in the promoter region and 5′UTR has mostly negative correlations with gene expression while gene body and 3′UTR associated methylation has positive correlations. Regulatory element analysis suggests that HOX cluster and histone core proteins are upstream regulators of hypomethylation, while SMAD4, STAT4, STAT5B and zinc finger proteins (ZNF) are upstream regulators of hypermethylation. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering of differentially methylated sites generated three clusters in PCs suggesting the existence of distinct molecular subtypes. Cluster 1 and cluster 2 showed samples enriched with clinical phenotypes like neoplasm histological grade and pathologic T-stage T3, respectively, while cluster 3 showed the enrichment of samples with neoplasm histological grade G1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first genome-scale methylome analysis of PC data from TCGA. Our clustering analysis provides a strong basis for future work on the molecular subtyping of epigenetic regulation in pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {Cancer develops by accumulation of somatic driver mutations, which impact cellular function. Mutations in non-coding regulatory regions can now be studied genome-wide and further characterized by correlation with gene expression and clinical outcome to identify driver candidates. Using a new two-stage procedure, called ncDriver, we first screened 507 ICGC whole-genomes from 10 cancer types for non-coding elements, in which mutations are both recurrent and have elevated conservation or cancer specificity. This identified 160 significant non-coding elements, including the TERT promoter, a well-known non-coding driver element, as well as elements associated with known cancer genes and regulatory genes (e.g., PAX5, TOX3, PCF11, MAPRE3). However, in some significant elements, mutations appear to stem from localized mutational processes rather than recurrent positive selection in some cases. To further characterize the driver potential of the identified elements and shortlist candidates, we identified elements where presence of mutations correlated significantly with expression levels (e.g., TERT and CDH10) and survival (e.g., CDH9 and CDH10) in an independent set of 505 TCGA whole-genome samples. In a larger pan-cancer set of 4128 TCGA exomes with expression profiling, we identified mutational correlation with expression for additional elements (e.g., near GATA3, CDC6, ZNF217, and CTCF transcription factor binding sites). Survival analysis further pointed to MIR122, a known marker of poor prognosis in liver cancer. In conclusion, the screen for significant mutation patterns coupled with correlative mutational analysis identified new individual driver candidates and suggest that some non-coding mutations recurrently affect expression and play a role in cancer development., Mutations in the “non-coding” part of the genome have been identified that could be involved in driving cancer development. Jakob Pedersen, Henrik Hornshøj and colleagues from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark and MIT in the United States developed a two-stage procedure to identify elements that could be driving cancer development in the part of DNA that does not code for proteins. They conducted statisical analyses on catalogs of tumor genomes to identify recurrent mutations. They then evaluated how specific these mutations were to different cancer types, their predicted functional impact, and their association with gene expression and patient survival. The analyses identified mutations in the non-coding part of cancer genomes that could be driving tumor development, but further analyses on larger sample sets need to be conducted to validate the results, which could provide a basis for biomarker discovery and precision medical treatment.},

Here, we develop a statistically founded non-coding driver-detection method, ncdDetect, which includes sample-specific mutational signatures, long-range mutation rate variation, and position-specific impact measures. Using ncdDetect, we screened non-coding regulatory regions of protein-coding genes across a pan-cancer set of whole-genomes (n = 505), which top-ranked known drivers and identified new candidates. For individual candidates, presence of non-coding mutations associates with altered expression or decreased patient survival across an independent pan-cancer sample set (n = 5454). This includes an antigen-presenting gene (CD1A), where 5’UTR mutations correlate significantly with decreased survival in melanoma. Additionally, mutations in a base-excision-repair gene (SMUG1) correlate with a C-to-T mutational-signature. Overall, we find that a rich model of mutational heterogeneity facilitates non-coding driver identification and integrative analysis points to candidates of potential clinical relevance., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21778.001, Cancers are diseases caused by changes in DNA sequences. Some changes occur in the protein-coding part of the DNA sequence, in other words, in the stretches of DNA that include the instructions to make a given protein. Other changes occur in the remaining parts of the DNA that do not code for proteins, which accounts for about 98\% of the human genome. Modern technologies allow us to identify these DNA changes, but, up until recently, this has only been possible for the protein-coding part of the DNA. Many studies have thus analyzed DNA changes in the protein-coding part of the human genome, while the larger, non-coding part remains rather unexplored., Advances in technology means that large datasets are becoming available where changes in DNA sequences are identified across the entire genomes of a collection of cancer patients. However, it is not clear which of these DNA changes play a role in the development of cancer and which are neutral with no effect on cancer., Now, Juul et al. have developed a new method, named 'ncdDetect', to search the human genome and identify stretches of DNA that when changed give cancer cells an advantage and allow them to grow. Juul et al. refer to these DNA stretches as 'driver elements', and, after analyzing the genomes from 505 patients with cancer, they identified some known driver elements and some potentially new ones. For example, possible driver elements were found in non-coding parts of the DNA that regulate genes called SMUG1 and CD1A. Both of these genes encode proteins that had been linked to cancer in the past, but driver elements had not previously been described in the nearby non-coding regions. Juul et al. also found a number of possible driver elements that might be important to consider in the treatment of cancers., Importantly, not all the candidate driver elements identified with ncdDetect are true drivers. The changes in DNA vary greatly between different types of cancer and even between different cases of a single type of cancer. Understanding and describing this variation continues to be a challenge in identifying driver elements, and so Juul et al. plan to keep improving the method to make sure that the driver elements it identifies are all trustworthy., DOI:

In this study, we investigated the role of NRDC in the promotion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), both clinically and experimentally. We found that NRDC expression was upregulated threefold in HCC tissue compared to the adjacent non‐tumor liver tissue, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. We also found that high serum NRDC was associated with large tumor size ({\textgreater}3 cm, P = 0.016) and poor prognosis after hepatectomy (median survival time 32.0 vs 73.9 months, P = 0.003) in patients with hepatitis C (n = 120). Diethylnitrosamine‐induced hepatocarcinogenesis was suppressed in heterozygous NRDC‐deficient mice compared to their wild‐type littermates. Gene silencing of NRDC with miRNA diminished the growth of Huh‐7 and Hep3B spheroids in vitro. Notably, phosphorylation of STAT3 was decreased in NRDC‐depleted Huh‐7 spheroids compared to control spheroids. The effect of a STAT3 inhibitor (S3I‐201) on the growth of Huh‐7 spheroids was reduced in NRDC‐depleted cells relative to controls.

Cox-nnet also reveals richer biological information, at both the pathway and gene levels.

With the re-gaining popularity of artificial neural networks, we asked if a refined neural network model could be used to predict patient survival, as an alternative to the conventional methods, such as Cox proportional hazards (Cox-PH) methods with LASSO or ridge penalization. To this end, we have developed a neural network extension of the Cox regression model, called Cox-nnet. It is optimized for survival prediction from high throughput gene expression data, with comparable or better performance than other conventional methods. More importantly, Cox-nnet reveals much richer biological information, at both the pathway and gene levels, by analyzing features represented in the hidden layer nodes in Cox-nnet.

TCGA provides 'Level 3' data, which have been processed using a pipeline specific to that resource. However, we have found using experimentally derived data that this pipeline produces gene-expression values that vary considerably across biological replicates. In addition, some RNA-Sequencing analysis tools require integer-based read counts, which are not provided with the Level 3 data. As an alternative, we have reprocessed the data for 9264 tumor and 741 normal samples across 24 cancer types using the Rsubread package. We have also collated corresponding clinical data for these samples. We provide these data as a community resource.
RESULTS: We compared TCGA samples processed using either pipeline and found that the Rsubread pipeline produced fewer zero-expression genes and more consistent expression levels across replicate samples than the TCGA pipeline. Additionally, we used a genomic-signature approach to estimate HER2 (ERBB2) activation status for 662 breast-tumor samples and found that the Rsubread data resulted in stronger predictions of HER2 pathway activity. Finally, we used data from both pipelines to classify 575 lung cancer samples based on histological type. This analysis identified various non-coding RNA that may influence lung-cancer histology.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Cancer evolves through microevolution where random lesions that provide the biggest advantage to cancer stand out in their frequent occurrence in multiple samples. At the same time, a gene function can be changed by aberration of the corresponding gene or modification of microRNA (miRNA) expression, which attenuates the gene. In a large number of cancer samples, these two mechanisms might be distributed in a coordinated and almost mutually exclusive manner. Understanding this coordination may assist in identifying changes which significantly produce the same functional impact on cancer phenotype, and further identify genes that are universally required for cancer. Present methodologies for finding aberrations usually analyze single datasets, which cannot identify such pairs of coordinating genes and miRNAs.
RESULTS: We have developed MIRAGAA, a statistical approach, to assess the coordinated changes of genome copy numbers and miRNA expression. We have evaluated MIRAGAA on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Glioblastoma Multiforme datasets. In these datasets, a number of genome regions coordinating with different miRNAs are identified. Although well known for their biological significance, these genes and miRNAs would be left undetected for being less significant if the two datasets were analyzed individually.

There are two main advantages to combining these measurements. First, we have the opportunity to obtain a more precise and accurate estimate of expression levels than using the individual platforms alone. Second, the combined measure simplifies downstream analysis by eliminating the need to work with three sets of expression measures and to consolidate results from the three platforms., We propose to use factor analysis (FA) to obtain a unified gene expression measure (UE) from multiple platforms. The UE is a weighted average of the three platforms, and is shown to perform well in terms of accuracy and precision. In addition, the FA model produces parameter estimates that allow the assessment of the model fit., The R code is provided in .

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Using whole exome sequencing to predict aberrations in tumours is a cost effective alternative to whole genome sequencing, however is predominantly used for variant detection and infrequently utilised for detection of somatic copy number variation.
RESULTS: We propose a new method to infer copy number and genotypes using whole exome data from paired tumour/normal samples. Our algorithm uses two Hidden Markov Models to predict copy number and genotypes and computationally resolves polyploidy/aneuploidy, normal cell contamination and signal baseline shift. Our method makes explicit detection on chromosome arm level events, which are commonly found in tumour samples. The methods are combined into a package named ADTEx (Aberration Detection in Tumour Exome). We applied our algorithm to a cohort of 17 in-house generated and 18 TCGA paired ovarian cancer/normal exomes and evaluated the performance by comparing against the copy number variations and genotypes predicted using Affymetrix SNP 6.0 data of the same samples. Further, we carried out a comparison study to show that ADTEx outperformed its competitors in terms of precision and F-measure.
CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method, ADTEx, uses both depth of coverage ratios and B allele frequencies calculated from whole exome sequencing data, to predict copy number variations along with their genotypes.

More than a hundred driver mutations have been characterized that confer the advantage of cell growth. However, how driver mutations regulate the transcriptome to affect cellular functions remains largely unexplored. Differential analysis of gene expression relative to a driver mutation on patient samples could provide us with new insights in understanding driver mutation dysregulation in tumor genome and developing personalized treatment strategies., Results: Here, we introduce the Snowball approach as a highly sensitive statistical analysis method to identify transcriptional signatures that are affected by a recurrent driver mutation. Snowball utilizes a resampling-based approach and combines a distance-based regression framework to assign a robust ranking index of genes based on their aggregated association with the presence of the mutation, and further selects the top significant genes for downstream data analyses or experiments. In our application of the Snowball approach to both synthesized and TCGA data, we demonstrated that it outperforms the standard methods and provides more accurate inferences to the functional effects and transcriptional dysregulation of driver mutations., Availability and implementation: R package and source code are available from CRAN at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DESnowball, and also available at http://bioinfo.mc.vanderbilt.edu/DESnowball/., Contact:

Most effort in modeling these datasets focuses on the detection of univariate differentially expressed genes. However, for classification, we must consider multiple genes and their interactions.
RESULTS: Thus, we introduce a hierarchical multivariate Poisson model (MP) and the associated optimal Bayesian classifier (OBC) for classifying samples using sequencing data. Lacking closed-form solutions, we employ a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach to perform classification. We demonstrate superior or equivalent classification performance compared to typical classifiers for two synthetic datasets and over a range of classification problem difficulties. We also introduce the Bayesian minimum mean squared error (MMSE) conditional error estimator and demonstrate its computation over the feature space. In addition, we demonstrate superior or leading class performance over an RNA-Seq dataset containing two lung cancer tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Omics Pipe provides researchers with a tool for reproducible, open source and extensible next generation sequencing analysis. The goal of Omics Pipe is to democratize next-generation sequencing analysis by dramatically increasing the accessibility and reproducibility of best practice computational pipelines, which will enable researchers to generate biologically meaningful and interpretable results.
RESULTS: Using Omics Pipe, we analyzed 100 TCGA breast invasive carcinoma paired tumor-normal datasets based on the latest UCSC hg19 RefSeq annotation. Omics Pipe automatically downloaded and processed the desired TCGA samples on a high throughput compute cluster to produce a results report for each sample. We aggregated the individual sample results and compared them to the analysis in the original publications. This comparison revealed high overlap between the analyses, as well as novel findings due to the use of updated annotations and methods.

We evaluated iTRAQ reporter ions, label-free spectral counts, and label-free extracted ion chromatograms as strategies for data interpretation (source code is available from http://homepages.uc.edu/{\textasciitilde}wang2x7/Research.htm ). From these assessments, we found that differential genes from a single replicate were confirmed by other replicates on the same instrument from 61 to 93\% of the time. When comparing across different instruments and quantitative technologies, using multiple replicates, differential genes were reproduced by other data sets from 67 to 99\% of the time.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical and biological effects of metabolic alterations in cancer are not fully understood.
METHODS: In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) samples (n = 101), over 170 metabolites were profiled and compared with normal ovarian tissues (n = 15). To determine NAT8L gene expression across different cancer types, we analyzed the RNA expression of cancer types using RNASeqV2 data available from the open access The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) website (http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/). Using NAT8L siRNA, molecular techniques and histological analysis, we determined cancer cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and tumor growth in in vitro and in vivo (n = 6-10 mice/group) settings. Data were analyzed with the Student's t test and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: Patients with high levels of tumoral NAA and its biosynthetic enzyme, aspartate N-acetyltransferase (NAT8L), had worse overall survival than patients with low levels of NAA and NAT8L. The overall survival duration of patients with higher-than-median NAA levels (3.6 years) was lower than that of patients with lower-than-median NAA levels (5.1 years, P = .03). High NAT8L gene expression in other cancers (melanoma, renal cell, breast, colon, and uterine cancers) was associated with worse overall survival. NAT8L silencing reduced cancer cell viability (HEYA8: control siRNA 90.61\% ± 2.53, NAT8L siRNA 39.43\% ± 3.00, P {\textless} .001; A2780: control siRNA 90.59\% ± 2.53, NAT8L siRNA 7.44\% ± 1.71, P {\textless} .001) and proliferation (HEYA8: control siRNA 74.83\% ± 0.92, NAT8L siRNA 55.70\% ± 1.54, P {\textless} .001; A2780: control siRNA 50.17\% ± 4.13, NAT8L siRNA 26.52\% ± 3.70, P {\textless} .001), which was rescued by addition of NAA. In orthotopic mouse models (ovarian cancer and melanoma), NAT8L silencing reduced tumor growth statistically significantly (A2780: control siRNA 0.52 g ± 0.15, NAT8L siRNA 0.08 g ± 0.17, P {\textless} .001; HEYA8: control siRNA 0.79 g ± 0.42, NAT8L siRNA 0.24 g ± 0.18, P = .008, A375-SM: control siRNA 0.55 g ± 0.22, NAT8L siRNA 0.21 g ± 0.17 g, P = .001). NAT8L silencing downregulated the anti-apoptotic pathway, which was mediated through FOXM1.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the NAA pathway has a prominent role in promoting tumor growth and represents a valuable target for anticancer therapy.Altered energy metabolism is a hallmark of cancer (1). Proliferating cancer cells have much greater metabolic requirements than nonproliferating differentiated cells (2,3). Moreover, altered cancer metabolism elevates unique metabolic intermediates, which can promote cancer survival and progression (4,5). Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that proliferating cancer cells exploit alternative metabolic pathways to meet their high demand for energy and to accumulate biomass (6-8).},

An improved understanding of the generative mechanisms behind the mutation rules and their influence on gene community behavior is of great importance for the study of cancer.
RESULTS: To expand our capability to analyze combinatorial patterns of cancer alterations, we developed a rigorous methodology for cancer mutation pattern discovery based on a new, constrained form of correlation clustering. Our new algorithm, named C3 (Cancer Correlation Clustering), leverages mutual exclusivity of mutations, patient coverage and driver network concentration principles. To test C3, we performed a detailed analysis on TCGA breast cancer and glioblastoma data and showed that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art CoMEt method in terms of discovering mutually exclusive gene modules and identifying biologically relevant driver genes. The proposed agnostic clustering method represents a unique tool for efficient and reliable identification of mutation patterns and driver pathways in large-scale cancer genomics studies, and it may also be used for other clustering problems on biological graphs.

	abstract = {Motivation: Comprehensive catalogue of genes that drive tumor initiation and progression in cancer is key to advancing diagnostics, therapeutics and treatment. Given the complexity of cancer, the catalogue is far from complete yet. Increasing evidence shows that driver genes exhibit consistent aberration patterns across multiple-omics in tumors. In this study, we aim to leverage complementary information encoded in each of the omics data to identify novel driver genes through an integrative framework. Specifically, we integrated mutations, gene expression, DNA copy numbers, DNA methylation and protein abundance, all available in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and developed iDriver, a non-parametric Bayesian framework based on multivariate statistical modeling to identify driver genes in an unsupervised fashion. iDriver captures the inherent clusters of gene aberrations and constructs the background distribution that is used to assess and calibrate the confidence of driver genes identified through multi-dimensional genomic data.
Results: We applied the method to 4 cancer types in TCGA and identified candidate driver genes that are highly enriched with known drivers. (e.g.: P {\textless} 3.40 × 10 -36 for breast cancer). We are particularly interested in novel genes and observed multiple lines of supporting evidence. Using systematic evaluation from multiple independent aspects, we identified 45 candidate driver genes that were not previously known across these 4 cancer types. The finding has important implications that integrating additional genomic data with multivariate statistics can help identify cancer drivers and guide the next stage of cancer genomics research.

	abstract = {Motivation: Cancer is not a single disease and involves different subtypes characterized by different sets of molecules. Patients with different subtypes of cancer often react heterogeneously towards the same treatment. Currently, clinical diagnoses rather than molecular profiles are used to determine the most suitable treatment. A molecular level approach will allow a more precise and informed way for making treatment decisions, leading to a better survival chance and less suffering of patients. Although many computational methods have been proposed to identify cancer subtypes at molecular level, to the best of our knowledge none of them are designed to discover subtypes with heterogeneous treatment responses.
Results: In this article we propose the Survival Causal Tree (SCT) method. SCT is designed to discover patient subgroups with heterogeneous treatment effects from censored observational data. Results on TCGA breast invasive carcinoma and glioma datasets have shown that for each subtype identified by SCT, the patients treated with radiotherapy exhibit significantly different relapse free survival pattern when compared to patients without the treatment. With the capability to identify cancer subtypes with heterogeneous treatment responses, SCT is useful in helping to choose the most suitable treatment for individual patients.

It is biologically desired to be capable of identifying cancer pathway modules through coordination between coverage and exclusivity. There have been a few approaches developed for this purpose, but they all have limitations in practice due to their computational complexity and prediction accuracy. We present a network based approach, CovEx, to predict the specific patient oriented modules by 1) discovering candidate modules for each considered gene, 2) extracting significant candidates by harmonizing coverage and exclusivity and, 3) further selecting the patient oriented modules based on a set cover model. Applying CovEx to pan-cancer datasets spanning 12 cancer types collecting from public database TCGA, it demonstrates significant superiority over the current leading competitors in performance.

Although true single-cell genomic technologies are rapidly improving, they remain too noisy and costly at present for population-level studies. Bulk sequencing remains the standard for population-scale tumor genomics, creating a need for computational tools to separate contributions of multiple tumor clones and assorted stromal and infiltrating cell populations to pooled genomic data. All such methods are limited to coarse approximations of only a few cell subpopulations, however. In prior work, we demonstrated the feasibility of improving cell type deconvolution by taking advantage of substructure in genomic mixtures via a strategy called simplicial complex unmixing. We improve on past work by introducing enhancements to automate learning of substructured genomic mixtures, with specific emphasis on genome-wide copy number variation (CNV) data, as well as the ability to process quantitative RNA expression data, and heterogeneous combinations of RNA and CNV data. We introduce methods for dimensionality estimation to better decompose mixture model substructure; fuzzy clustering to better identify substructure in sparse, noisy data; and automated model inference methods for other key model parameters. We further demonstrate their effectiveness in identifying mixture substructure in true breast cancer CNV data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

	abstract = {Background
Feature selection and prediction are the most important tasks for big data mining. The common strategies for feature selection in big data mining are L
1, SCAD and MC+. However, none of the existing algorithms optimizes L
0, which penalizes the number of nonzero features directly.

Results
In this paper, we develop a novel sparse generalized linear model (GLM) with L
0 approximation for feature selection and prediction with big omics data. The proposed approach approximate the L
0 optimization directly. Even though the original L
0 problem is non-convex, the problem is approximated by sequential convex optimizations with the proposed algorithm. The proposed method is easy to implement with only several lines of code. Novel adaptive ridge algorithms (L
0ADRIDGE) for L
0 penalized GLM with ultra high dimensional big data are developed. The proposed approach outperforms the other cutting edge regularization methods including SCAD and MC+ in simulations. When it is applied to integrated analysis of mRNA, microRNA, and methylation data from TCGA ovarian cancer, multilevel gene signatures associated with suboptimal debulking are identified simultaneously. The biological significance and potential clinical importance of those genes are further explored.

0ADRIDGE in MATLAB is available at https://github.com/liuzqx/L0adridge.

	abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate expression of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) post-transcriptionally. Understanding the precise regulatory role of miRNAs is of great interest since miRNAs have been shown to play an important role in development, diseases, and other biological processes. Early work on miRNA target prediction has focused on static sequence-driven miRNA-mRNA complementarity. However, recent research also utilizes expression-level data to study context-dependent regulation effects in a more dynamic, physiologically-relevant setting. Methods: We propose a novel artificial neural network (ANN) based method, named Tiresias, to predict such targets in a context-dependent manner by combining sequence and expression data. In order to predict the interacting pairs among miRNAs and mRNAs and their regulatory weights, we develop a two-stage ANN and present how to train it appropriately. Tiresias is designed to study various regulation models, ranging from a simple linear model to a complex non-linear model. Tiresias has a single hyper-parameter to control the sparsity of miRNA-mRNA interactions, which we optimize using Bayesian optimization. Results: Tiresias performs better than existing computational methods such as GenMiR++, Elastic Net, and PIMiM, achieving an F1 score of {\textgreater}0.8 for a certain level of regulation strength. For the TCGA breast invasive carcinoma dataset, Tiresias results in the rate of up to 82\% in detecting the experimentally-validated interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs, even if we assume that true regulations may result in a low level of regulation strength. Conclusion: Tiresias is a two-stage ANN, computational method that deciphers context-dependent microRNA regulatory interactions. Experiment results demonstrate that Tiresias outperforms existing solutions and can achieve a high F1 score. Source code of Tiresias is available at https://bitbucket.org/cellsandmachines/.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A comprehensive understanding of cancer has been furthered with technological improvements and decreasing costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, the complexity of interpreting genomic data is hindering the implementation of high-throughput technologies in the clinical context: increasing evidence on gene-drug interactions complicates the task of assigning clinical significance to genomic variants.
METHODS: Here we present a method that automatically matches patient-specific genomic alterations to treatment options. The method relies entirely on public knowledge of somatic variants with predictive evidence on drug response. The output report is aimed at supporting clinicians in the task of finding the clinical meaning of genomic variants. We applied the method to 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) cohorts and 2) 11 patients from the NCT MASTER trial whose treatment discussions included information on their genomic profiles.
RESULTS: Our reporting strategy showed a substantial number of patients with actionable variants in the analyses of TCGA and GENIE samples. Notably, it was able to reproduce experts' treatment suggestions in a retrospective study of 11 patients from the NCT MASTER trial. Our results establish a proof of concept for comprehensive, evidence-based reports as a supporting tool for discussing treatment options in tumor boards.
CONCLUSIONS: We believe that a standardized method to report actionable somatic variants will smooth the incorporation of NGS in the clinical context. We anticipate that tools like the one we present here will become essential in summarizing for clinicians the growing evidence in the field of precision medicine.

Method: We propose GIFT, a Guided and Interpretable Factorization for Tensors. GIFT provides interpretable factor matrices by encoding prior knowledge as a regularization term in its objective function.

	abstract = {DNA methylation plays an important role in the development of various cancers mainly through the regulation on gene expression. Hence, the study on the relation between DNA methylation and gene expression is of particular interest to understand cancers. Recently, an increasing number of datasets are available from multiple cancers, which makes it possible to study both the similarity and difference of genomic alterations across multiple tumor types. However, most of the existing pan-cancer analysis methods perform simple aggregations, which may overlook the heterogeneity of the interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel method to jointly detect complex associations between DNA methylation and gene expression levels from multiple cancers. The main idea is to apply joint sparse canonical correlation analysis to detect a small set of methylated sites, which are associated with another set of genes either shared across cancers or specific to a particular group (group-specific) of cancers. These methylated sites and genes form a complex module with strong multivariate correlations. We further introduced a joint sparse precision matrix estimation method to identify driver methylation-gene pairs in the module. These pairs are characterized by significant partial correlations, which may imply high functional impacts and contribute to complementary information to the main step. We apply our method to The Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA) datasets with 1166 samples from four cancers. The results reveal significant shared and groupspecific interactions between DNA methylation and gene expression levels.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are approximately 22-nucleotide long regulatory RNA that mediate RNA interference by binding to cognate mRNA target regions. Here, we present a distributed kernel SVM-based binary classification scheme to predict miRNA targets. It captures the spatial profile of miRNA-mRNA interactions via smooth B-spline curves. This is accomplished separately for various input features, such as thermodynamic and sequence-based features. Further, we use a principled approach to uniformly model both canonical and non-canonical seed matches, using a novel seed enrichment metric. Finally, we verify our miRNA-mRNA pairings using an Elastic Net-based regression model on TCGA expression data for four cancer types to estimate the miRNAs that together regulate any given mRNA.
RESULTS: We present a suite of algorithms for miRNA target prediction, under the banner Avishkar, with superior prediction performance over the competition. Specifically, our final kernel SVM model, with an Apache Spark backend, achieves an average true positive rate (TPR) of more than 75 percent, when keeping the false positive rate of 20 percent, for non-canonical human miRNA target sites. This is an improvement of over 150 percent in the TPR for non-canonical sites, over the best-in-class algorithm. We are able to achieve such superior performance by representing the thermodynamic and sequence profiles of miRNA-mRNA interaction as curves, devising a novel seed enrichment metric, and learning an ensemble of miRNA family-specific kernel SVM classifiers. We provide an easy-to-use system for large-scale interactive analysis and prediction of miRNA targets. All operations in our system, namely candidate set generation, feature generation and transformation, training, prediction, and computing performance metrics are fully distributed and are scalable.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed an efficient SVM-based model for miRNA target prediction using recent CLIP-seq data, demonstrating superior performance, evaluated using ROC curves for different species (human or mouse), or different target types (canonical or non-canonical). We analyzed the agreement between the target pairings using CLIP-seq data and using expression data from four cancer types. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first distributed framework for miRNA target prediction based on Apache Hadoop and Spark.

Elastic net was used to construct a gene expression signature by contrasting GS 8-10 vs. ≤6 tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. The constructed signature was then evaluated for its ability to predict recurrence and metastatic-lethal (ML) progression in a Fred Hutchinson (FH) patient cohort (N=408; NRecurrence=109; NMLprogression=27). The expression signature included transcripts representing 49 genes. In the FH cohort, a 25\% increase in the signature was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.51 (P=2.7×10−5) for recurrence. The signature's area under the curve (AUC) for predicting recurrence and ML progression was 0.68 and 0.76, respectively. Compared to a model with age at diagnosis, pathological stage and GS, the gene expression signature improved the AUC for recurrence (3\%) and ML progression (6\%). Higher levels of the signature were associated with increased expression of genes in cell cycle-related pathways and decreased expression of genes in androgen response, estrogen response, oxidative phosphorylation, and apoptosis.

	abstract = {Purpose
Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) is used clinically to differentiate primary lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) from squamous lung cancers and metastatic adenocarcinomas from other primary sites. However, a subset of LUAD (15-20\%) does not express TTF1 and TTF1-negative patients have worse clinical outcomes. As there are no established targeted agents with activity in TTF1-negative LUAD, we performed an integrated molecular analysis to identify potential therapeutic targets.

Experimental Design
Using two clinical LUAD cohorts (274 tumors), one from our institution (PROSPECT) and the TCGA, we interrogated proteomic profiles (by reverse-phase protein array (RPPA)), gene expression, and mutational data. Drug response data from 74 cell lines were used to validate potential therapeutic agents.

Results
Strong correlations were observed between TTF1 IHC and TTF1 measurements by RPPA (Rho=0.57, p{\textless}0.001) and gene expression (NKX2-1, Rho=0.61, p{\textless}0.001). Established driver mutations (e.g. BRAF and EGFR) were associated with high TTF1 expression. In contrast, TTF1-negative LUAD had a higher frequency of inactivating KEAP1 mutations (p=0.001). Proteomic profiling identified increased expression of DNA repair proteins (e.g., Chk1 and the DNA repair score) and suppressed PI3K/MAPK signaling among TTF1-negative tumors, with differences in total proteins confirmed at the mRNA level. Cell line analysis showed drugs targeting DNA repair to be more active in TTF1-low cell lines.

Conclusions
Combined genomic and proteomic analyses demonstrated infrequent alteration of validated lung cancer targets (including the absence of BRAF mutations in TTF1-negative LUAD), but identified novel potential targets for TTF1-negative LUAD includingKEAP1/Nrf2 and DNA repair pathways.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive types of cancer with limited therapeutic options and unfavorable prognosis. Stemness and non-classical epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (ncEMT) features underlie the switch from normal to neoplastic states as well as resistance of tumor clones to current therapies. Therefore, identification of ligand/receptor systems maintaining this privileged state is needed to devise efficient cancer therapies. In this study, we show that the expression of CD95 associates with stemness and EMT features in GBM tumors and cells and serves as a prognostic biomarker. CD95 expression increases in tumors and with tumor relapse as compared with non-tumor tissue. Recruitment of the activating PI3K subunit, p85, to CD95 death domain is required for maintenance of EMT-related transcripts. A combination of the current GBM therapy, temozolomide, with a CD95 inhibitor dramatically abrogates tumor sphere formation. This study molecularly dissects the role of CD95 in GBM cells and contributes the rational for CD95 inhibition as a GBM therapy.},

	abstract = {Increasing evidence has demonstrated that microRNA (miR)-133a-3p is an important regulator of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, the diagnostic role of miR-133a-3p in HCC, and the potential functional pathways, were both explored based on publicly available data. Eligible microarray datasets were collected from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and ArrayExpress database. The data related to HCC and matched adjacent normal tissues were also downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Published studies reporting the association between miR-133a-3p expression and HCC were reviewed from multiple databases. By combining the data derived from three sources (GEO, TCGA and published studies), the authors analyzed the comprehensive relationship between miR-133a-3p expression and clinicopathological features of HCC. Eventually, putative targets of miR-133a-3p in HCC were selected for further bioinformatics prediction. A total of eight published microarray datasets were gathered, and the pooled results demonstrated that the expression of miR-133a-3p in the tumor group was lower than that in normal groups [standardized mean difference (SMD)=−0.54; 95\% confidence interval (CI), −0.74 to −0.35; P{\textless}0.001]. Consistently, the level of miR-133a-1 in HCC was reduced markedly compared to normal tissues (P{\textless}0.001) based on TCGA data, and the AUC value of low miR-133a-1 expression for HCC diagnosis was 0.670 (P{\textless}0.001). Furthermore, the combined SMD of all datasets (GEO, TCGA and literature) suggested that significant difference was observed between the HCC group and the normal control group, and lower miR-133a-3p expression in HCC group was noted (SMD=−0.69; 95\% CI, −1.10 to −0.29; P=0.001). In addition, the authors discovered five key genes of the calcium signaling pathway (NOS1, ADRA1A, ADRA1B, ADRA1D and TBXA2R) that may probably be targeted by miR-133a-3p in HCC. The study reveals that miR-133a-3p may function as a tumor suppressor in HCC. The prospective novel pathways and key genes of miR-133a-3p could offer potential biomarkers for HCC; however, the predictions require further confirmation.},

We identified multiple potentially targetable proteins upregulated in SCC, including NRF2, Keap1, PARP, TrkB, and Chk2. Of these potential targets, we found that TrkB also had significant increases in gene expression in SCC as compared to adenocarcinoma. Thus, we next validated the upregulation of TrkB both in vitro and in vivo and found that it was constitutively expressed at high levels in a subset of SCC cell lines. Furthermore, we found that TrkB inhibition suppressed tumor growth, invasiveness and sensitized SCC cells to tyrosine kinase EGFR inhibition in a cell-specific manner.},

	abstract = {How the BRAF V600E mutation promotes the pathogenesis and aggressiveness of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is not completely understood. Here we explored a novel mechanism involving WASP interacting protein family member 1 (WIPF1). In PTC tumors, compared with the wild-type BRAF, BRAF V600E was associated with over-expression and hypomethylation of the WIPF1 gene. In thyroid cancer cell lines with wild-type BRAF, WIPF1 expression was robustly upregulated upon introduced expression of BRAF V600E (P=0.03) whereas the opposite was seen upon BRAF knockdown or treatment with BRAF V600E or MEK inhibitors in cells harboring BRAF V600E. Methylation of a functionally critical region of the WIPF1 promoter was decreased by expressing BRAF V600E in cells harboring the wild-type BRAF and increased by BRAF knockdown or treatment with BRAF V600E or MEK inhibitors in cells harboring BRAF V600E mutation. Under-expression and hypermethylation of WIPF1 induced by stable BRAF knockdown was reversed by DNA demethylating agent 5′-azadeoxycytidine. Knockdown of WIPF1 robustly inhibited anchorage-independent colony formation, migration, and invasion of thyroid cancer cells and suppressed xenograft thyroid cancer tumor growth and vascular invasion, mimicking the effects of BRAF knockdown. In human PTC tumors, WIPF1 expression was associated with extrathyroidal invasion (P=0.01) and lymph node metastasis (P=2.64E-05). In summary, BRAF V600E-activated MAP kinase pathway causes hypomethylation and overexpression of WIPF1; WIPF1 then functions like an oncoprotein to robustly promote aggressive cellular and tumor behaviors of PTC. This represents a novel mechanism in BRAF V600E-promoted PTC aggressiveness and identifies WIPF1 as a novel therapeutic target for thyroid cancer.},

DNA hypermethylation profiles differ significantly by HPV status suggesting that a specific subset of methylated CpG loci could give mechanistic insight into HPV-driven OPSCC. We analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation of primary tumor samples and adjacent normal mucosa from 46 OPSCC patients undergoing treatment at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 beadchip. For each matched tissue set, we measured differentially methylated CpG loci using a change in methylation level (M value). From these analyses, we identified a 22 CpG loci panel for HPV+ OPSCC that included four CDKN2A loci downstream of the p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) transcription start sites. This panel was significantly associated with overall HPV detection (P {\textless} 0.05; ROC area under the curve = 0.96, 95\% CI: 0.91–1.0) similar to the subset of four CDKN2A-specific CpG loci (0.90, 95\% CI: 0.82–0.99) with equivalence to the full 22 CpG panel. DNA hypermethylation correlated with a significant increase in alternative open reading frame (ARF) expression in HPV+ OPSCC primary tumors, but not to the other transcript variant encoded by the CDKN2A locus. Overall, this study provides evidence of epigenetic changes to the downstream region of the CDKN2A locus in HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer that are associated with changes in expression of the coded protein products.},

We recently reported that Elafin is overexpressed by HGSOC and is associated with poor overall survival. Here, we confirmed that Elafin overexpression is associated with shorter survival in 1000 HGSOC patients. Elafin confers a proliferative advantage to tumor cells through activation of the MAP kinase pathway. This mitogenic effect can be neutralized by RNA interference, specific antibodies, and a MEK inhibitor. Elafin expression in patient-derived samples was also associated with chemoresistance and strongly correlates with bcl-xL expression. We extended these findings into examination of 1100 primary breast tumors and six breast cancer cell lines. We observed that Elafin is overexpressed and secreted specifically by BLBC tumors and cell lines, leading to a similar mitogenic effect through activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Here too, Elafin overexpression is associated with poor overall survival, suggesting that it may serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target in this setting.},

This approach has revealed extensive complexity both in intrinsic features of the tumor cells and in the microenvironment. However, global gene expression cannot distinguish between gene expression signals originating from the tumor cells proper and from normal cells in the biopsy. Here, we use a large cohort of advanced urothelial carcinomas for which both gene expression data and extensive immunohistochemistry are available to create a supervised mRNA expression centroid classifier. This classifier identifies the major Lund taxonomy tumor cell phenotypes as defined by IHC. We apply this classifier to the independent TCGA dataset and show excellent associations between identified subtypes and genomic features. We validate a progressed version of Urothelial-like A (UroA-Prog) that shows FGFR3 mutations and CDKN2A deletions, and we show that the variant Urothelial-like C is almost devoid of FGFR3 mutations. We show that Genomically Unstable tumors are very distinct from Urothelial-like tumors at the genomic level, and that tumors classified as Basal/SCC-like all complied with the established definition for Basal/SCC-like tumors. We identify the Mesenchymal-like and Small-cell/Neuroendocrine-like subtypes, and demonstrate that patients with UroB and Sc/NE-like tumors show the worst overall survival.},

However, these responses only occur in a subset of patients. Elucidating the determinants of response and resistance is key to improving outcomes and developing new treatment strategies. Here, we examined tumours from a large cohort of mUC patients treated with an anti–PD-L1 agent (atezolizumab) and identified major determinants of clinical outcome. Response was associated with CD8+ T-effector cell phenotype and, to an even greater extent, high neoantigen or tumour mutation burden (TMB). Lack of response was associated with a signature of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signalling in fibroblasts, particularly in patients with CD8+ T cells that were excluded from the tumour parenchyma and instead found in the fibroblast- and collagen-rich peritumoural stroma—a common phenotype among patients with mUC. Using a mouse model that recapitulates this immune excluded phenotype, we found that therapeutic administration of a TGF-β blocking antibody together with anti–PD-L1 reduced TGF-β signalling in stromal cells, facilitated T cell penetration into the centre of the tumour, and provoked vigorous anti-tumour immunity and tumour regression. Integration of these three independent biological features provides the best basis for understanding outcome in this setting and suggests that TGF-β shapes the tumour microenvironment to restrain anti-tumour immunity by restricting T cell infiltration.},

	abstract = {The correct identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between specific conditions is a key in the understanding phenotypic variation. High-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the main option for these studies. Thus, the number of methods and softwares for differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data also increased rapidly. However, there is no consensus about the most appropriate pipeline or protocol for identifying differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. This work presents an extended review on the topic that includes the evaluation of six methods of mapping reads, including pseudo-alignment and quasi-mapping and nine methods of differential expression analysis from RNA-Seq data. The adopted methods were evaluated based on real RNA-Seq data, using qRT-PCR data as reference (gold-standard). As part of the results, we developed a software that performs all the analysis presented in this work, which is freely available at https://github.com/costasilvati/consexpression. The results indicated that mapping methods have minimal impact on the final DEGs analysis, considering that adopted data have an annotated reference genome. Regarding the adopted experimental model, the DEGs identification methods that have more consistent results were the limma+voom, NOIseq and DESeq2. Additionally, the consensus among five DEGs identification methods guarantees a list of DEGs with great accuracy, indicating that the combination of different methods can produce more suitable results. The consensus option is also included for use in the available software.},

	abstract = {It is crucial for researchers to optimize RNA-seq experimental designs for differential expression detection. Currently, the field lacks general methods to estimate power and sample size for RNA-Seq in complex experimental designs, under the assumption of the negative binomial distribution. We simulate RNA-Seq count data based on parameters estimated from six widely different public data sets (including cell line comparison, tissue comparison, and cancer data sets) and calculate the statistical power in paired and unpaired sample experiments. We comprehensively compare five differential expression analysis packages (DESeq, edgeR, DESeq2, sSeq, and EBSeq) and evaluate their performance by power, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, and other metrics including areas under the curve (AUC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and F-measures. DESeq2 and edgeR tend to give the best performance in general. Increasing sample size or sequencing depth increases power; however, increasing sample size is more potent than sequencing depth to increase power, especially when the sequencing depth reaches 20 million reads. Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNA) yields lower power relative to the protein coding mRNAs, given their lower expression level in the same RNA-Seq experiment. On the other hand, paired-sample RNA-Seq significantly enhances the statistical power, confirming the importance of considering the multifactor experimental design. Finally, a local optimal power is achievable for a given budget constraint, and the dominant contributing factor is sample size rather than the sequencing depth. In conclusion, we provide a power analysis tool (http://www2.hawaii.edu/{\textasciitilde}lgarmire/RNASeqPowerCalculator.htm) that captures the dispersion in the data and can serve as a practical reference under the budget constraint of RNA-Seq experiments.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/bty525},
	abstract = {Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with the length of ∼22 nucleotides. miRNAs are involved in many biological processes including cancers. Recent studies show that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as miRNA sponges, playing important roles in cancer physiology and development. Despite accumulating appreciation of the importance of lncRNAs, the study of their complex functions is still in its preliminary stage. Based on the hypothesis of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), several computational methods have been proposed for investigating the competitive relationships between lncRNAs and miRNA target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). However, when the mRNAs are released from the control of miRNAs, it remains largely unknown as to how the sponge lncRNAs influence the expression levels of the endogenous miRNA targets.
Results: We propose a novel method to construct lncRNA related miRNA sponge regulatory networks (LncmiRSRNs) by integrating matched lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles with clinical information and putative miRNA-target interactions. Using the method, we have constructed the LncmiRSRNs for 4 human cancers (glioblastoma multiforme, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer). Based on the networks, we discover that after being released from miRNA control, the target mRNAs are normally up-regulated by the sponge lncRNAs, and only a fraction of sponge lncRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships and hub lncRNAs are shared by the 4 cancers. Moreover, most sponge lncRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships show a rewired mode between different cancers, and a minority of sponge lncRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships conserved (appearing) in different cancers may act as a common pivot across cancers. Besides, differential and conserved hub lncRNAs may act as potential cancer drivers to influence the cancerous state in cancers. Functional enrichment and survival analysis indicate that the identified differential and conserved LncmiRSRN network modules work as functional units in biological processes, and can distinguish metastasis risks of cancers. Our analysis demonstrates the potential of integrating expression profiles, clinical information and miRNA-target interactions for investigating lncRNA regulatory mechanism.

对于基因芯片的数据而言，由于样本服从正态分布，所以可以用t-test（双处理）或anova分析（多处理以上）。
现在的RNA-Seq，它的抽样过程是离散的，结果是count，服从泊松分布，样本间的差异是服从负二向分布，显然不能按照上述方法分析。
 
如果响应变量不是连续型分布，就要使用更加一般化的广义线性模型（generalized linear model),通过一个连接函数变换响应变量期望，将响应变量的期望与自变量建立线性关系。
 
注：推荐在统计检验前过滤表达量低，也就如果一个基因在所有样本中count均低于某一阀值，请在分析前剔除。这个阀值也是约定俗成，一般设置为3.
 
说一比较尴尬的事情，在统计检验中你找到越多的差异表达基因，在p值矫正之后，你反而找不到差异表达基因。也就是说，如果在结果中存在大量滥竽充数的所谓的DE基因，那么在严格的p值矫正筛选后，反而会误删真实的DE基因。}

	doi = {10.1093/ndt/gfy128},
	abstract = {Clinical epidemiological studies often focus on investigating the underlying causes of disease. For instance, a nephrologist may be interested in the association between blood pressure and the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, instead of focusing on the mere occurrence of CKD, the decline of kidney function over time might be the outcome of interest. For examining this kidney function trajectory, patients are typically followed over time with their kidney function estimated at several time points. During follow-up, some patients may drop out earlier than others and for different reasons. Furthermore, some patients may have greater kidney function at study entry or faster kidney function decline than others. Also, a substantial heterogeneity may exist in the number of kidney function estimates available for each patient. This heterogeneity with respect to kidney function, dropout and number of kidney function estimates is important to take into account when estimating kidney function trajectories. In general, two methods are used in the literature to estimate kidney function trajectories over time: linear regression to estimate individual slopes and the linear mixed-effects model (LMM), i.e. repeated measures analysis. Importantly, the linear regression method does not properly take into account the above-mentioned heterogeneity, whereas the LMM is able to retain all information and variability in the data. However, the underlying concepts, use and interpretation of LMMs are not always straightforward. Therefore we illustrate this using a clinical example and offer a framework of how to model and interpret the LMM.},

The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased blood pressure is the biggest contributor to the global burden of disease and mortality. Data suggest that less than half of the population with hypertension is aware of it. May Measurement Month was initiated to raise awareness of the importance of blood pressure and as a pragmatic interim solution to the shortfall in screening programmes.
METHODS: This cross-sectional survey included volunteer adults (≥18 years) who ideally had not had their blood pressures measured in the past year. Each participant had their blood pressure measured three times and received a a questionnaire about demographic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. The primary objective was to raise awareness of blood pressure, measured by number of countries involved, number of people screened, and number of people who have untreated or inadequately treated hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg, or both, or on the basis of receiving antihypertensive medication). Multiple imputation was used to estimate the mean of the second and third blood pressure readings if these were not recorded. Measures of association were analysed using linear mixed models.
FINDINGS: Data were collected from 1 201 570 individuals in 80 countries. After imputation, of the 1 128 635 individuals for whom a mean of the second and third readings was available, 393 924 (34·9\%) individuals had hypertension. 153 905 (17·3\%) of 888 616 individuals who were not receiving antihypertensive treatment were hypertensive, and 105 456 (46·3\%) of the 227 721 individuals receiving treatment did not have controlled blood pressure. Significant differences in adjusted blood pressures and hypertension prevalence were apparent between regions. Adjusted blood pressure was higher in association with antihypertensive medication, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Blood pressure was higher when measured on the right arm than on the left arm, and blood pressure was highest on Saturdays.
INTERPRETATION: Inexpensive global screening of blood pressure is achievable using volunteers and convenience sampling. Pending the set-up of systematic surveillance systems worldwide, MMM will be repeated annually to raise awareness of blood pressure.

	abstract = {The longitudinal data from 2 published clinical trials in adult subjects with upper limb spasticity (a randomized placebo-controlled study [NCT01313299] and its long-term open-label extension [NCT01313312]) were combined. Their study designs involved repeat intramuscular injections of abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport®), and efficacy endpoints were collected accordingly. With the objective of characterizing the pattern of response across cycles, Mixed Model Repeated Measures analyses and Non-Linear Random Coefficient (NLRC) analyses were performed and their results compared. The Mixed Model Repeated Measures analyses, commonly used in the context of repeated measures with missing dependent data, did not involve any parametric shape for the curve of changes over time. Based on clinical expectations, the NLRC included a negative exponential function of the number of treatment cycles, with its asymptote and rate included as random coefficients in the model. Our analysis focused on 2 specific efficacy parameters reflecting complementary aspects of efficacy in the study population. A simulation study based on a similar study design was also performed to further assess the performance of each method under different patterns of response over time. This highlighted a gain of precision with the NLRC model, and most importantly the need for its assumptions to be verified to avoid potentially biased estimates. These analyses describe a typical situation and the conditions under which non-linear mixed modeling can provide additional insights on the behavior of efficacy parameters over time. Indeed, the resulting estimates from the negative exponential NLRC can help determine the expected maximal effect and the treatment duration required to reach it.},

	abstract = {Targeted proteomics based on selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry is commonly used for accurate and reproducible quantification of protein analytes in complex biological mixtures. Strictly hypothesis-driven, SRM assays quantify each targeted protein by collecting measurements on its peptide fragment ions, called transitions. To achieve sensitive and accurate quantitative results, experimental design and data analysis must consistently account for the variability of the quantified transitions. This consistency is especially important in large experiments, which increasingly require profiling up to hundreds of proteins over hundreds of samples. Here we describe a robust and automated workflow for the analysis of large quantitative SRM data sets that integrates data processing, statistical protein identification and quantification, and dissemination of the results. The integrated workflow combines three software tools: mProphet for peptide identification via probabilistic scoring; SRMstats for protein significance analysis with linear mixed-effect models; and PASSEL, a public repository for storage, retrieval and query of SRM data. The input requirements for the protocol are files with SRM traces in mzXML format, and a file with a list of transitions in a text tab-separated format. The protocol is especially suited for data with heavy isotope–labeled peptide internal standards. We demonstrate the protocol on a clinical data set in which the abundances of 35 biomarker candidates were profiled in 83 blood plasma samples of subjects with ovarian cancer or benign ovarian tumors. The time frame to realize the protocol is 1–2 weeks, depending on the number of replicates used in the experiment.},

	abstract = {Misalignment of the endogenous circadian timing system leads to disruption of physiological rhythms and may contribute to the development of the deleterious health effects associated with night shift work. However, the molecular underpinnings remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effect of a 4-day simulated night shift work protocol on the circadian regulation of the human transcriptome. Repeated blood samples were collected over two 24-hour measurement periods from eight healthy subjects under highly controlled laboratory conditions before and 4 days after a 10-hour delay of their habitual sleep period. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells to obtain transcriptomic data. Cosinor analysis revealed a marked reduction of significantly rhythmic transcripts in the night shift condition compared with baseline at group and individual levels. Subsequent analysis using a mixed-effects model selection approach indicated that this decrease is mainly due to dampened rhythms rather than to a complete loss of rhythmicity: 73\% of transcripts rhythmically expressed at baseline remained rhythmic during the night shift condition with a similar phase relative to habitual bedtimes, but with lower amplitudes. Functional analysis revealed that key biological processes are affected by the night shift protocol, most notably the natural killer cell-mediated immune response and Jun/AP1 and STAT pathways. These results show that 4 days of simulated night shifts leads to a loss in temporal coordination between the human circadian transcriptome and the external environment and impacts biological processes related to the adverse health effects associated to night shift work.},

The precise, and possibly distinct, roles of attention and memory in time perception remain debated. In this behavioral study, we tested 48 participants in a prospective duration estimation task while they fully attended to time or performed a working memory (WM) task. We report that paying attention to time lengthened perceived duration in the range of seconds to minutes, whereas diverting attention away from time shortened perceived duration. The overestimation due to attending to time did not scale with durations. To the contrary, increasing WM load systematically decreased subjective duration and this effect scaled with durations. Herein, we discuss the dissociation between attention and WM in timing and scalar variability from the perspective of Bayesian models of time estimations.},

	title = {Unequalslopes:  {Making} life easier when the proportional odds assumption fails},
	abstract = {With the advent of SAS 9.3 came the proc logistic model option, unequalslopes. This new option allows the programmer to quickly produce results for cumulative logit models which fail the assumption of proportionality. Models thus become either partially proportional or non-proportional. Previously, these models could be programmed using the procedure NLMixed, but this new capability of proc logistic provides an easier task for the SAS writer and an analyst friendly output. Ordinal responses use these models to capture the inherent information of their ordering. Hoping to make it easy to generalize the interpretation and programming of partial and non-proportional logit equations, the response variable, number of episodes, will be a count (1,2,3, or 4) against 2 categorical independent variables, rank and level, with 5 and 3 categories, respectively. Working from simpler to more complex models, the body of the paper will be split into three parts: Proportional Odds Model, Partial Proportional Odds Model, and NonProportional Odds Model. Each section will display the model equations, the NLmixed code, NLmixed results logistic code, and finally logistic results. It would be easy to digress, thus the focus will be on looking at the proportional odds assumption and interpretation of the odds ratios. The NLmixed code along with the mathematical equations should give a deeper understanding of the logistic output, hence making it easier to explain the results to any audience.},

	abstract = {Predicting the probability of the occurrence of a binary outcome or condition is important in biomedical research. While assessing discrimination is an essential issue in developing and validating binary prediction models, less attention has been paid to methods for assessing model calibration. Calibration refers to the degree of agreement between observed and predicted probabilities and is often assessed by testing for lack‐of‐fit. The objective of our study was to examine the ability of graphical methods to assess the calibration of logistic regression models. We examined lack of internal calibration, which was related to misspecification of the logistic regression model, and external calibration, which was related to an overfit model or to shrinkage of the linear predictor. We conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations with a locally weighted least squares regression smoother (i.e., the loess algorithm) to examine the ability of graphical methods to assess model calibration. We found that loess‐based methods were able to provide evidence of moderate departures from linearity and indicate omission of a moderately strong interaction. Misspecification of the link function was harder to detect. Visual patterns were clearer with higher sample sizes, higher incidence of the outcome, or higher discrimination. Loess‐based methods were also able to identify the lack of calibration in external validation samples when an overfit regression model had been used. In conclusion, loess‐based smoothing methods are adequate tools to graphically assess calibration and merit wider application. © 2013 The Authors.

We aimed to identify predictors and construct a nomogram for predicting the pathologically complete response (pCR) of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) after NCT in node positive breast cancer patients. In total, 426 patients with pathologically proven ALN metastasis before NCT were enrolled, randomized 1:1 and divided into a training set and a validation set. We developed a nomogram based on independent predictors for ALN pCR identified by multivariate logistic regression as well as clinical significant predictors. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hormone receptor (HR) status, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) status and Ki67 index were independent predictors. The nomogram was thereby constructed by those independent predictors as well as tumor size and NCT regimens. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the training set and the validation set were 0.804 and 0.749, respectively. We constructed a nomogram for predicting ALN pCR in patients who received NCT. Our nomogram can improve risk stratification, accurately predict post-NCT ALN status and avoid unnecessary ALN dissection.},

Bilirubin exhibits a potent antioxidant effect and an inverse relationship has been reported between bilirubin levels and the risk of several atherosclerotic diseases; however, there is limited evidence with regard to the effect of bilirubin levels on cerebrovascular diseases including DWMLs. This cross-sectional study included 1121 apparently healthy Japanese adults. The subjects were divided into three groups according to their bilirubin levels (low, {\textless}0.5 mg/dl; intermediate, ≥0.5 mg/dl and {\textless}1.0 mg/dl; and high, ≥1.0 mg/dl). The severity of DWMLs was evaluated according to Fazekas scale and their relation to bilirubin levels was examined. The association between bilirubin levels and the presence of severe DWMLs was assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The analysis revealed that the low- and intermediate bilirubin groups indicated 2.36- and 1.33-fold increase in the prevalence of severe DWMLs compared with the high-bilirubin group, respectively (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.12–4.97 (the low-bilirubin group), 95\% CI: 0.85–2.07 (the intermediate-bilirubin group). In conclusion, low total bilirubin levels could be associated with a high prevalence of severe DWMLs in apparent healthy subjects.},

	abstract = {民国期间,社会几乎一直处在动荡不安中。可以说,民国的历史是一部政权频繁更迭、战乱不断的历史。在大部分时间里,统治阶层无暇顾及医学教育,当然这也和清末、民初西医教育一直为外国势力所垄断有关。统治阶层无暇顾及医学教育的结果,使医学教育几乎处于自然发展的状态,当局虽偶有教育改革政令,多数情况下应者寥寥。政府的不作为,却也给了医学教育自由发展的空间,特别是在1926年至1937年这段时间里,政局相对稳定,民国西医发展也流派纷呈,成为民国西医教育发展的辉煌时期。     我国西医教育源于传教士。从客观上讲,传教士和教会医院在把西医引进中国和培训医务人员上功不可没。另外,西方国家在中国的西医派别之争,在学术上起到了百家争鸣的效果,这也促进了民国西医学术的发展。但这些传教士与国外政府或团体,有些是为本国的侵略政策服务,也有一些是抱着人道主义或宗教信仰的原因来到中国办医学教育。所以,我们对西医来华的评价在看到贡献的同时,也不应该忽略其负面影响。     本文写作的主要目的便是重新去追寻那段历史,尽量去还原历史的本来面目,从中探寻民国医学教育的发展脉络,总结得失,给历史以应有的尊重:谁为民国的西医教育做出了贡献?有哪些贡献?民国为新中国的医学教育又贡献了什么?如何评价民国的西医教育?     由于一篇论文无法面面俱到,综合各方面因素,本文最终选择从四个角度切入民国医学教育的历史。也就是说,本文在结构安排上共分四章。     第一章从时间维度上对民国西医教育做一个总体的把握。为了研究的方便,把民国西医高等教育划分为三个时期来展开:奋力前行的萌芽时期(1912年——1926年);西医教育本土化及其鼎盛时期(1927年——1937年);逆境图存的低谷时期(1937年——1949年)。本章对民国前期西医的出现及其发展情况亦作了简要的回顾,作为本章第一节的内容。     第二章对民国西医高等教育采取了从类型切入,进行分类研究。分类的依据既考虑了各院校的主办者,又考虑创办的时间顺序,分为四类,每一类选取其典型代表进行论述:教会医学在民国期间无论在办学数量还是在办学质量上都是首屈一指的,影响也最大,因此,教会西医高等教育便作为第一种类型,圣约翰大学医学院以其鲜明的特点和高质量而成为教会医学教育的典型代表;第二种类型为国民政府办西医高等教育(含国立和省立),主要以国立北京医学专门学校和上海医学院为例;第三种类型为外国政府或财团办学,主要选择同济作为例子;受教育救国、实业救国思想的影响,一些实业家开始创办教育——国内私人办学为第四种类型。并且在章末对这四种类型院校的办学经验及其得失进行了对比分析。},

Motivation
I’m not a machine learning expert. I’m a software engineer by training and I’ve had little interaction with AI. I had always wanted to delve deeper into machine learning, but never really found my “in”. That’s why when Google open sourced TensorFlow in November 2015, I got super excited and knew it was time to jump in and start the learning journey. Not to sound dramatic, but to me, it actually felt kind of like Prometheus handing down fire to mankind from the Mount Olympus of machine learning. In the back of my head was the idea that the entire field of Big Data and technologies like Hadoop were vastly accelerated when Google researchers released their Map Reduce paper. This time it’s not a paper – it’s the actual software they use internally after years and years of evolution.

So I started learning what I can about the basics of the topic, and saw the need for gentler resources for people with no experience in the field. This is my attempt at that.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is known as the second largest cause of cancer deaths among women, but thankfully it can be cured if diagnosed early. There have been many investigations on methods to improve the accuracy of the diagnostic, and Machine Learning (ML) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) tools are among the most successfully employed modern methods. On the other hand, Logistic Regression (LR), a traditional and popular statistical method for classification, is not commonly used by computer scientists as those modern methods usually outperform it. Here we show that LR can achieve results that are similar to those of ML and EC methods and can even outperform them when useful knowledge is discovered in the dataset. In this paper, we employ the recently proposed Kaizen Programming (KP) approach with LR to construct high-quality nonlinear combinations of the original features resulting in new sets of features. Experimental analysis indicates that the new sets provide significantly better predictive accuracy than the original ones. When compared to related work from the literature, it is shown that the proposed approach is competitive and a promising method for automatic feature construction.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose a computer-assisted method for distinguishing uterine sarcoma from leiomyomas based on perfusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two women confirmed to have a total of 60 masses (10 uterine sarcomas and 50 benign leiomyomas) were included. The reference diagnosis was based on postoperative histopathological examination. All women underwent the standard MRI protocol with 3-Tesla MR imager (Magnetom Trio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) for assessment of myometrial masses, followed by PWI. For each mass, two regions of interest (ROI) were outlined manually by an experienced radiologist; one (ROIL) represented the entire tumor while the other (ROIs) was placed on the area of the lesion with the most marked contrast enhancement. Two additional ROIs with diameters similar to ROIs (3.0 to 3.1 mm) were placed on psoas muscle (ROIP) and myometrium (ROIM) in order to provide baselines for comparisons. The obtained ROIs of PWI images were then analyzed using the DCE Tool plug-in (version 2.0SP1) within ClearCanvas (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) framework. The DCE Tool provides seven parameters (Ktrans, kep, Vb, IAUC, initial slope, peak, the mean squared error) for modelling contrast uptake within an ROI using the modified Tofts model. Parameters extracted from the ROIs were fed into a decision tree ensemble, which classified the corresponding lesions either as malignant or benign. The leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was utilized to evaluate the performance of the classifier.
RESULTS: None of the parameters extracted from ROIL or ROIs differed significantly between uterine sarcoma and benign leiomyomas (all p {\textgreater} 0.05). The overall accuracy of 66.7\% was obtained by feeding seven parameters extracted from ROIL to the classifier. When 21 features extracted from ROIL, ROIM, and ROIP were fed into the classifier an accuracy of 91.7\%, sensitivity of 100\%, and specificity of 90\% were achieved in the optimal operating point of classifier.
CONCLUSION: Although none of the PWI parameters differed significantly between benign and malignant lesions, when the information provided by the extracted features was aggregated using a machine learning method, a promising discriminative power was obtained. This suggests that the proposed model for combining the PWI parameters is potentially useful for differentiating uterine sarcoma from leiomyomas.},

	abstract = {Introducing novel biomarkers for accurately detecting and differentiating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) using clinical samples is essential. In the current study, we searched for a novel data-driven gene signature of synovial tissues to differentiate RA from OA patients. Fifty-three RA, 41 OA, and 25 normal microarray-based transcriptome samples were utilized. The area under the curve random forests (RF) variable importance measurement was applied to seek the most influential differential genes between RA and OA. Five algorithms including RF, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector machines (SVM), naïve-Bayes, and a tree-based method were employed for the classification. We found a 16-gene signature that could effectively differentiate RA from OA, including TMOD1, POP7, SGCA, KLRD1, ALOX5, RAB22A, ANK3, PTPN3, GZMK, CLU, GZMB, FBXL7, TNFRSF4, IL32, MXRA7, and CD8A. The externally validated accuracy of the RF model was 0.96 (sensitivity = 1.00, specificity = 0.90). Likewise, the accuracy of kNN, SVM, naïve-Bayes, and decision tree was 0.96, 0.96, 0.96, and 0.91, respectively. Functional meta-analysis exhibited the differential pathological processes of RA and OA; suggested promising targets for further mechanistic and therapeutic studies. In conclusion, the proposed genetic signature combined with sophisticated classification methods may improve the diagnosis and management of RA patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, the assessment of mental disorders has become more and more personalized. Modern advancements such as Internet-enabled mobile phones and increased computing capacity make it possible to tap sources of information that have long been unavailable to mental health practitioners.
OBJECTIVE: Software packages that combine algorithm-based treatment planning, process monitoring, and outcome monitoring are scarce. The objective of this study was to assess whether the DynAMo Web application can fill this gap by providing a software solution that can be used by both researchers to conduct state-of-the-art psychotherapy process research and clinicians to plan treatments and monitor psychotherapeutic processes.
METHODS: In this paper, we report on the current state of a Web application that can be used for assessing the temporal structure of mental disorders using information on their temporal and synchronous associations. A treatment planning algorithm automatically interprets the data and delivers priority scores of symptoms to practitioners. The application is also capable of monitoring psychotherapeutic processes during therapy and of monitoring treatment outcomes. This application was developed using the R programming language (R Core Team, Vienna) and the Shiny Web application framework (RStudio, Inc, Boston). It is made entirely from open-source software packages and thus is easily extensible.
RESULTS: The capabilities of the proposed application are demonstrated. Case illustrations are provided to exemplify its usefulness in clinical practice.
CONCLUSIONS: With the broad availability of Internet-enabled mobile phones and similar devices, collecting data on psychopathology and psychotherapeutic processes has become easier than ever. The proposed application is a valuable tool for capturing, processing, and visualizing these data. The combination of dynamic assessment and process- and outcome monitoring has the potential to improve the efficacy and effectiveness of psychotherapy.},

The representations learned by the network are adapted to the temporal statistics of the input.

Anomaly detection is important for several application domains such as financial and communication services, public health, and climate studies. In this paper, we focus on discovery of anomalies in monthly temperature data using DBSCAN algorithm. DBSCAN algorithm is a density-based clustering algorithm that has the capability of discovering anomalous data. In the experimental evaluation, we compared the results of DBSCAN algorithm with the results of a statistical method. The analysis showed that DBSCAN has several advantages over the statistical approach on discovering anomalies.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore and compare multiple solutions to the problem of
data augmentation in image classification. Previous work has demonstrated the
effectiveness of data augmentation through simple techniques, such as cropping,
rotating, and flipping input images. We artificially constrain our access to
data to a small subset of the ImageNet dataset, and compare each data
augmentation technique in turn. One of the more successful data augmentations
strategies is the traditional transformations mentioned above. We also
experiment with GANs to generate images of different styles. Finally, we
propose a method to allow a neural net to learn augmentations that best improve
the classifier, which we call neural augmentation. We discuss the successes and
shortcomings of this method on various datasets.},

	abstract = {Tumour budding has been described as an independent prognostic feature in several tumour types. We report for the first time the relationship between tumour budding and survival evaluated in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. A machine learning-based methodology was applied to accurately quantify tumour buds across immunofluorescence labelled whole slide images from 100 muscle invasive bladder cancer patients. Furthermore, tumour budding was found to be correlated to TNM (p = 0.00089) and pT (p = 0.0078) staging. A novel classification and regression tree model was constructed to stratify all stage II, III, and IV patients into three new staging criteria based on disease specific survival. For the stratification of non-metastatic patients into high or low risk of disease specific death, our decision tree model reported that tumour budding was the most significant feature (HR = 2.59, p = 0.0091), and no clinical feature was utilised to categorise these patients. Our findings demonstrate that tumour budding, quantified using automated image analysis provides prognostic value for muscle invasive bladder cancer patients and a better model fit than TNM staging.},

	abstract = {Do men and women have different brains? Previous neuroimage studies sought to answer this question based on morphological difference between specific brain regions, reporting unfortunately conflicting results. In the present study, we aim to use a deep learning technique to address this challenge based on a large open-access, diffusion MRI database recorded from 1,065 young healthy subjects, including 490 men and 575 women healthy subjects. Different from commonly used 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we proposed a 3D CNN method with a newly designed structure including three hidden layers in cascade with a linear layer and a terminal Softmax layer. The proposed 3D CNN was applied to the maps of factional anisotropy (FA) in the whole-brain as well as specific brain regions. The entropy measure was applied to the lowest-level image features extracted from the first hidden layer to examine the difference of brain structure complexity between men and women. The obtained results compared with the results from using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). The proposed 3D CNN yielded a better classification result (93.3\%) than the SVM (78.2\%) on the whole-brain FA images, indicating gender-related differences likely exist in the whole-brain range. Moreover, high classification accuracies are also shown in several specific brain regions including the left precuneus, the left postcentral gyrus, the left cingulate gyrus, the right orbital gyrus of frontal lobe, and the left occipital thalamus in the gray matter, and middle cerebellum peduncle, genu of corpus callosum, the right anterior corona radiata, the right superior corona radiata and the left anterior limb of internal capsule in the while matter. This study provides a new insight into the structure difference between men and women, which highlights the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in brain research.},
